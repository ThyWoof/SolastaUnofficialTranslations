Background/&KS_GarradMilesBackground_Description An orphan from the streets of Caer Cyflen, Garrad survived thanks to a little luck and a lot of stubbornness.\nHe began as an apprentice cutpurse for the Thieves' Guild, but when he grew too big and too noticeable to melt into the crowds with a score, his masters decided that he would make a good crippled beggar.\n\nUnwilling to be maimed for the profit of others, he fled the Guild and the city by enlisting in the army.\nAfter a couple of years at a border fort near the Kingdom of Gallivan, Garrad hired himself out to merchants as a caravan guard, and spent time in several mercenary "free companies," raiding the Marches in the name of one noble or another. Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. \n\nAs the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer the call. More than anything, he hopes that one dark night, in some quiet alley, he will meet the sadistic guildmaster who planned to maim him for profit.\n

Background/&KS_RhuadSwiftHandBackground_Description Rhuad always had a glib tongue and a swift hand, but one day he picked the wrong pocket. \nUnder the laws of the Principality he could have suffered a number of harsh punishments, but instead the mage who caught him red-handed - a fellow sylvan elf - sent him to the Treasurer's office for training.\n\nThus the Principality gained a swift, stealthy, and cunning spy whose greed is kept in check by the knowledge - and by regular reminders from his masters - that any transgression will lead to the swift and inevitable punishment for his original crime.\nRhuad remains a loyal agent of the Principality. He harbors a deep-seated hatred of the New Empire, where he began his life as a slave.

Background/&KS_VigdisKaikonnenBackground_Description Vigdis is the youngest daughter of Kaikkonen Vartija, the current head of the powerful Kaikkonen border clan in the Snow Alliance.\nSince girlhood she was known for her stubbornness and her strong sense of right and wrong. When she learned that her family planned to marry her into an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. \nReaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.\nWhile her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.\nEven though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon matches her temperament perfectly.\n

Background/&KS_VioletGoodCheerBackground_Description Violet is an unusual marsh halfling. Instead of staying safely at home in the reeds, her wanderlust has carried her far away, to the principality of Masgarth. \nTo make things worse, instead of following the good and sensible path of the marsh mage that originated among her people, she has chosen to become a showy, destructive shock arcanist! \nHer family is mortified. Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been sensible… though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard.\nViolet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. \nShe sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win renown for themselves and their people. Her personal philosophy is based on freedom and personal accountability for one's actions. \n

CharacterFamily/&BeastDescription Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language.
CharacterFamily/&BeastTitle Beast
CharacterFamily/&CelestialDescription Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.

A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable.

CharacterFamily/&GiantDescription Giants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads or deformities.

CharacterFamily/&HumanoidDescription Humanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoids are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous are the goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.
CharacterFamily/&HumanoidTitle Humanoid
CharacterFamily/&MonstrosityDescription Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense - frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry, and others are the product of terrible curses. They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.

Deity/&EinarDescription Einar is the god of valor and fidelity, and the patron of paladins, lawful warriors, and all those who bring light to darkness. The Church of Einar is organized into three Orders: \nThe Blade is a militant order, a bulwark against chaos and evil.\nThe Shield is an order of protectors, devoted to their flock.\nThe Beacon is an order of itinerant preachers, helping the communities through which they travel with their strength at arms, their healing skills, and their knowledge of the law.
Deity/&EinarTitle Einar
Deity/&MaraikeDescription The goddess of life and death, the patron of healers and embalmers, and the embodiment of universal duality. Traditionally, she is Arun's wife. Her cult consists of two orders:\nThe Order of Life Regnant travels the land as healers and defenders. They worship the healing, motherly aspect of Maraike.\nThe Order of Oblivion is an order of avengers and embalmers. Where evil tries to pervert the cycle of life and death, the Order ensures that the culprits are dealt with, and their undead victims returned to their rest. 
Deity/&MaraikeTitle Maraike
Deity/&MisayeDescription The goddess of mischief, protector of rogues and swindlers, and patron of all those who chafe against rules and enjoy a little chaos. \nPriests of Misaye seldom live a relaxing life. Usually, they are one step ahead of the law - if they are lucky! Many lead a double life - normal citizens by day and priests of Misaye by night - because the cult of Misaye is outlawed in many nations and barely tolerated in most others.
Deity/&MisayeTitle Misaye
Deity/&PakriDescription The goddess of law and knowledge and patron of judges and lawyers, teachers, librarians, and scholars.\nShe gifted humans with the thirst for knowledge so they could learn and develop their society, and the law which preserves civilization.

Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\nAll the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n\nI do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2 Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n\nI buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.\n\nTraveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n\nThe beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3 It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites.

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1 Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2 A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.\n
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3 Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

Equipment/&CaerLem_Document_Inquisitor_Content My Dear Andrey,\nI have not had word of you since our desperate exodus to this dreadful world. My thoughts are with you, and I hope we will be reunited one day and live in peace at last.\nWe hoped for a friendly and peaceful world, far from the reach of the Enemy, but alas, we have found only fresh enemies, and our seers tell me that the Sorr-Akkath are not far behind. The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\nThey wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\nThese are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\nMay the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\nArtus

Equipment/&CaerLem_Document_MasterSmith_Content Memories of the War Foundry\nEntry 23
Equipment/&CaerLem_Document_MasterSmith_Content2 I must confess, the wonders of Solasta's enchanters are awe-inspiring.\nThanks to Laerin, my new friend at the war foundry, I've learned how to prime weapons for enchantment. Of course, only Laerin has the magical knowledge to complete the… miracle. Arun pardon me for this word, but what this elvish magic can accomplish is simply god-like. \nAlas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so. \nI have collected various enchantments, and I am not sure yet which one will please her most.

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1 It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.
Equipment/&HectorLetterContent2 I'm leaving this note in case the Tshar sends for me. I might not get out alive. I made a mistake going so deep, so near the amphitheater. The deep spiders are much more numerous than I thought, and they have killed my prisoner. I won't be able to become Hector. The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Faction/&ItemsScroll03_Title2 A rolled, sealed letter in a leather case.
Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Description Tomaz,\n\nI do hope these words find you good health, and I am sorry for not writing sooner. Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n\nYour words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter may be my last.\n\nLong ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible of my own making.\n\nWhen I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of violence my mother did not survive.\n\nAnd despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, for your love is unconditional.\n\nPlease, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a new beginning.\n\nMerilyn

Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Title2 A letter, written in haste on a torn-out scrap of paper.
Faction/&ItemsScroll05_Description I, Nilocyrel Dream-Minder, hereby bear witness of the miracle of light.\n\nAs part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and accompanied by the always interfering Imperial agents we were to investigate rumors of the sudden appearance of a seemingly magical construct of light deep in an uninhabited region of Aer-Elai. While fast-traveling through still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that had started to spread.\n\nSightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious difference in size.\n\nJudging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't had time to further research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know more about this kin.\n\nFour days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes upon before.\n\nIt is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of dread coming from this light. I entrust this interim report to an accompanying agent, who will travel back this night to report the coordinates this magical construct can be found at. Tomorrow we will advance further.

Thus, he developed a skill that gave him value in the eyes of the sylvan elves, who otherwise viewed him as imperfect and damaged.\nHe was also my brother.\nI covered his body with a cairn of stones on the riverbank where I found it.\nThey had taken his rod and his fish, the bracelet he had from our father, his fileting knife, everything.\nSo I tracked them. They were many, and arrogant, but I had little else to do, and all the time in the world.\nFour died before they learned to leave guards at night.\nTwo more before they learned to make sure the guards were sober.\nSix of them slept together in a tent; I slit the throats of the three largest and left the rest to their sweet dreams.\nBy the time they made Port Harrow they were telling stories of the hordes of night witches who descended upon them from the haunted boughs of Colthannin, drinking the blood of their friends and depopulating entire villages.\nMore died there, where they mistakenly believed the crowds would give them safety.\nAn envoy from my people came, asking me to stop. I indicated that I would do so the day my brother came back to life.\nI have not done so.\nStranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, I ask that you leave it be, and say a prayer for the soul of my brother.\nStranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, and disturb the cairn, or take the scroll, know that I will find you.\nThey call me Nightplague.

Faction/&ItemsScroll07_Description The Dragon's Den - Grand Opening: Come one, come all, join us on the 23rd of May for the Grand Opening of The Dragon's Den - Gallivan's newest tavern, eatery, and bordello. Enjoy one of 10 different ales, or perhaps a vintage cask of wine from our cellar while you enjoy rack of meat and freshly baked bread.\n\nNeed to satisfy a hunger of a different kind? Take a look at what we have to offer upstairs. Fancy a stout dwarf to rub out your tensions? We have three to choose from. Prefer something a little pointier with a slender frame? We have you covered with the fairest elven beauties in the land. We even have a halfling if you are into that sort of thing.\nIn celebration of our Grand Opening, we will also have a very special guest performer from 21:12 until closing time. The famous bard Neil Beart will be giving a rare solo performance, all the way from the Principality.\n\nOther opening day activities include:\n\nAxe throwing hosted by Runglia Silverbeard (yes, we even have a bearded "lady")\nTarot reading by Aelrindel the Wise\nBattle Chess Tournament\nMuch, much more!\nWe are located on the eastern edge of town, just past the town apothecary. And finally, a short poem from Lord Astaroth, a renowned battlemage and our sole proprietor.\n\nStained velvet, dirty lace,\nNaked glee on every face.\nOpen up to your inner desires,\nAs you lay here, by the fire.\n\nAll are welcome here,\nWithout worry, regret, or fear.\nSo pull up a chair and sit up straight,\nSome might even say it's fate.\n\nOh, my beautiful lady,\nSo fair, slim and shady,\nI'll meet you upstairs\nAfter I trim these pesky nose hairs…\n\nIn the Dragon's Den\nby Lord Astaroth Darkbane

NPC/&NPC_IlastarKeenmindAirgetineDescription Ilastar is a member of the noble house Airgetine, whose forefathers were wizards of the Arcaneum. As with many Imperial families of that time, his family was originally a minor branch of the clan and began to rise to prominence after the Cataclysm, as it backed the first Emperor ("The Wailing Emperor") who took the rough decisions ultimately leading to the survival of Civilization and to the rise of the New Empire. More than anybody else of his generation, Ilastar is aware of what was lost and was a major proponent of participating to the Council, in the hope of gathering magical materials and writings expanding his knowledge of magic and thus giving the empire an edge in future conflicts. His main worry is that historical documents come to the fore, revealing some truths better left alone.

NPC/&NPC_LeiraKeanDescription Leira Kean was born and raised in Heart of Valor, the city built around the Einareum. She discovered Einar fairly early in her life and many thought she would make a fine priestess. Instead she chose the path of the paladin, pledging her life to protect Solasta from all Sorr-Akkath-related dangers. Leira is a dedicated paladin with seriousness etched in her face. She is well-versed in history and fluent in ancient Tirmarian. She is a good fighter but also a keen judge of character. She is just and she listens and decides based on facts, not on hearsay or rumor. Those traits led to her nomination on the Council as Oathkeeper.

Tip/&LoadingTip04 You can customize your 3D dice in the Game Settings.

Tip/&LoadingTip14 To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring.
Tip/&LoadingTip15 In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers.
Tip/&LoadingTip16 Each player character can use a reaction once per turn. This allows them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip17 Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip18 Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too.
Tip/&LoadingTip19 Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn.
Tip/&LoadingTip20 Switch to cautious mode when exploring. You'll be slow, but better able to notice traps and footsteps.
Tip/&LoadingTip21 In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far.
Tip/&LoadingTip22 Most characters can jump two cells without a problem. Longer jumps require strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. You always have a chance to fall prone when landing if you jump far.
Tip/&LoadingTip23 Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities.
Tip/&LoadingTip25 After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character.
Tip/&LoadingTip26 To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen).
Tip/&LoadingTip27 Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death.
Tip/&LoadingTip28 When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative.
Tip/&LoadingTip29 Battles sometimes begin with one side being surprised. Surprised characters or creatures cannot act during the first round of battle.
Tip/&LoadingTip30 You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like.
Tip/&LoadingTip31 Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would.
Tip/&LoadingTip32 When you find a mysterious item, use Detect Magic first to determine whether it has magical properties. If it does, use Identify to learn how to use it.
Tip/&LoadingTip33 Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords.
Tip/&LoadingTip34 To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot.
Tip/&LoadingTip35 Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping.
Tip/&LoadingTip36 Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience.
Tip/&LoadingTip37 When speaking to an NPC, the most suitable character in the party will automatically use Insight to guess which approach is most likely to work with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip38 Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be.
Tip/&LoadingTip39 When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip40 Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip41 When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip42 Rogues can use sneak attack to increase their damage when they attack an enemy that is in a cell next to an ally, unless they have disadvantage on their attack roll.
Tip/&LoadingTip43 Wielding two Light weapons allows you to perform a second attack with your bonus actions. Both weapons need the Light tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip44 Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip45 A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword.
Tip/&LoadingTip47 To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up.

TutorialStep/&OutgameCharacterCreationAbilityScoresTitle Ability Scores
TutorialStep/&OutgameCharacterCreationAbilityScores2Description Ability scores can be generated in several ways, either randomly or using a point system. \n\nClasses have preferred ability scores - for example, Intelligence for a wizard - so make sure your character's highest scores are in their class's primary abilities.

TutorialStep/&Tuto_CampaignMap4_Title Travel Routine
TutorialStep/&Tuto_CampaignMap5_Description Sometimes the normal routine will be interrupted and your heroes will need to travel while they should be resting. This will add fatigue and may lead to exhaustion.\n\nAdventurers know how to push themselves temporarily and then return to their normal routine, limiting camping activities to get more rest so that fatigue is reduced. Do not let them get exhausted, as this can lead to terrible penalties.\n

TutorialStep/&Tuto_Telema_Identify2_Description Spells such as Detect Magic and Identify can be cast as rituals.\n\nThat means you don't need to expend a spell slot to cast them - you simply need to stay put for a while, since a ritual takes 10 minutes longer than normal casting.

Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance03 We had heard rumors, and then most of the elven troops garrisoned in our Valley left through the Gates to meet a dire threat, yet with enough left behind to ensure that imperial law still reigned supreme! \nOn this direst of days, the sky broke, lightning fell again and again, and - worst of all - magic failed! I remember quite vividly the ashen face of our resident wizard, a young scion of a minor branch of House Airgetine, as he told Eldoril Sharp-Blade, the officer left in charge of the Vale, that mana had disappeared and that he wasn't even able to light a candle with his magic. 
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance04 Eldoril Sharp-Blade, was a no-nonsense elven veteran who quickly realized that none of his contingency orders covered such an occurrence. Like every thrall, I was planning a rebellion against the imperial order. In the middle of the destruction wreaked by this Cataclysm, Eldoril made me realize that our fates were intertwined: Without magic, without the empire behind him, there was no way he would be able to compel us to behave like good little imperial thralls. On the other hand, some of his patrols had brought back the corpses of very dangerous-looking monsters, and his men had the equipment, discipline, and training needed to face such fearsome foes.   
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance05 If only it had been that simple… The young Airgetine wizard thought himself the equal of a master in wit, if not in power, and managed to convince his personal guard to follow him on a trek towards the imperial heartlands, away from the taint of this travesty of discussion with thralls. As Eldoril didn't want to pitch his troops against fellow elves, he let them go, with a heavy heart. It was the last we heard or saw of them.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance06 One year after the Cataclysm, I met my first humans. Eldoril was able to tell me they were not, as I had thought, enemies but rather refugees turned allies of the Empire. And what a sorry bunch they were: some elderly, children, women, not many fighting men among them, and they were following an old man, Egil Karst, decked in clothes the color of fire. This first winter had been more than dire, but somehow, the steep walls of our valley had shielded us, and we had room left to shelter those people, provided they could forage for their own food. At that, Egil Karst, the cleric of Arun, gave a little smile and, out of nothing, conjured up a feast for his followers.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance07 We were all dumbstruck, magic was returning… And yet, our few remaining arcanists confirmed they could not sense mana. Egil confirmed this, explaining that he was only a vessel channeling the mana offered by the gods so that his flock could survive. Those human gods were real, and their magic was functioning. And those humans were all skilled with their hands, not being used to having magic at their disposal for every single task. Soon, they weren't refugees anymore but valued members of our community, helping mend and repair with their hands and stone and wood, instead of with spells and mana. 
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance08 Their expertise was welcome as our foraging parties couldn't wander outside the fortress walls anymore, as the weather and the monsters had redoubled their assault. By now, even the fiercest of the anti-Manacalon among my miners approve of our tentative partnership with their erstwhile guards, as they have shown us that, no matter what their faults, their courage more than makes up for them. \nI am Kram Steel-Spine, the foreman of the mine, speaker to the elves, and Ceannard of the mines. Ceannard I remain, but of the whole Vale of Coparann, as we have chosen to rename our enclave. \nStrike true, fellow miners!
TutorialStep/&Crafting01Title Crafting
TutorialStep/&Crafting01Description In Solasta, you can craft various items. To do so, you need the proper equipment, ingredients, skill, and time. For magical items, sometimes you need to know spells.\n\nCrafting is performed while traveling, once your party has set up camp but is not yet sleeping.\n\nCharacters can devote some of their free time to working on their current crafting task.
TutorialStep/&Crafting02Title Crafting Equipment
TutorialStep/&Crafting02Description These are the tools required for crafting:\n\n-Potions: Herbalism kit\n-Scrolls: Scroll kit\n-Poisons: Poisoner's kit\n-Enchanted weapons and armor: Manacalon Rosary\n\nYou'll need to be proficient with these tools to use them.
TutorialStep/&Crafting03Title Crafting Skills
TutorialStep/&Crafting03Description Even if you're proficient with a given crafting tool, you'll still need specific skills to make successive checks against the recipe's DC.\nTo craft potions, sometimes Medicine is enough, but Arcana is very useful.\nTo craft poisons, Medicine or Nature is useful.\nTo craft scrolls or enchanted items, Arcana is a must. 
TutorialStep/&Crafting04Title Crafting Ingredients
TutorialStep/&Crafting04Description Crafting requires ingredients. They can be found while adventuring, gathered from flowers, bushes and rocks, sometimes from dead creatures. \nObviously, you can also buy them from shops, unless they are very rare.\nEnchanting requires Prime items that have been magically prepared for enchanting by Manacalon master smiths, whose secrets have been lost with the Cataclysm. Generally, a Primed Item will require a very rare additional ingredient to fulfill its potential.
TutorialStep/&Crafting05Title Crafting Recipes
TutorialStep/&Crafting05Description Finally, to craft an item, you need to know which ingredients to combine. These "recipes" can be learned by reading manuals or taught by masters. \nSolastan factions generally keep copies of recipes and sell them at good prices to their friends, but some can be found out there in the Badlands, too.\n\nOnce a recipe has been learned, all the party can use it.
TutorialStep/&Crafting06Title Crafting Interface
TutorialStep/&Crafting06Description To start crafting, open a character's screen and click on the Crafting tab. Simply select a recipe that is available to start.\nThe progress bar will fill as you travel, and you will be notified \nwhen the operation is over, so you can launch another one if you want.\nRemember that if you cancel a crafting operation, the ingredients are lost.

TutorialStep/&Tuto_SurpriseAttack3_Title Surprise Attack
TutorialStep/&Tuto_SurpriseAttack3_Description If you can sneak up close to enemies who are unaware of your presence, you can take them by surprise and force them to lose their first turn of a battle.\nTo do so, click on an attack option or attack spell with one of your characters, target an enemy, and confirm the attack.\nThis will start the battle and give you the advantage of surprise. Also, as long as your characters remain unseen, they have advantage on attack rolls.

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Description The Journal of Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content01 If found, please return to the Guild of Antiquarians at Caer Cyflen. A reward will be offered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02 Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03 Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04 Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content05 Substantial mausoleum at far end of the cemetery, built in First Expansion style. Inscription over doorway names 25th Iron Legion. Presumably officers were buried inside (and possibly in catacombs beneath, if the building filled up over time) while lower ranks occupy the surrounding graveyard.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06 The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07 Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content08 Another way into the mausoleum? Possible catacombs beneath - underground passage into the castle?
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09 2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy).
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content10 I watched from hiding as they explored the graveyard, apparently looking for something (me?). Extreme caution is indicated from now on.

Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content01 …upstairs to try to speak with Mardracht about it, but Aksha said he was resting and had left orders not to be disturbed - as usual. She offered to pass on a message - so helpful! - but I know it will never reach him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content02 For all I know she's told him I'm dead. She may be planning to make it true. He's so shaken and addled from the Cataclysm, he'd probably believe her. She could have killed him already - he could have been dead for centuries - but no: his magical defenses are still in place. He must be alive.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content03 If only I could reach him - free him from her influence - but I can't get past her and her ghouls. So frustrating! I need to arrange a sudden meeting with a wooden stake, but she's careful.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content04 Adam's no help. He won't join me against Aksha without orders from Mardracht, which of course can't come because she's got him isolated. How blind is he not to see that - I'll never yield the castle to her, no matter what she does. While Mardracht lives, I have to keep trying to save him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content05 …searching the graveyard as usual. The dwarf was there - he always thought I didn't see him, but I did - but now he's a ghost. Adam said he was an Antiquarian, some sort of scholar, so I tried to control him and find out what he knows.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content06 I was over-eager, though, and he got away. An opportunity lost. He might know something that could help me get past Aksha and her ghouls and free Mardracht from her influence. Someday, somehow, I will get rid of her. I will.

Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Description Excerpt from "The Blood-Fang Invasion"\nBy Ceannard, 8th of his name.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content01 It all began as a series of raids, pinpricks outside our walls, attacks on caravans. Enough to worry us and elicit a response, but nothing more! Alas! it was a trick and the raids proved to be guided by a cunning hand able to predict our reactions with unerring accuracy.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content02 And so the force we sent after the raiders got wiped out, almost to the last man. It was more than a raid from an orcish clan; it was a full invasion aimed at conquering our vale! We were almost surprised at the gates, but managed to close them in time! We had lost our finest but our walls were strong and we were able to produce weapons to replenish our depleted arrows and bolt stocks quite fast. This siege gave us pause, as we didn't quite understand its purpose. The only access to the Vale of Coparann goes through the pass blocked by our town and the fortress. The vale itself is only easily accessible if you can fly! Otherwise, the steep walls provide as fine a natural defense as I have ever seen! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content03 And yet, they were so numerous that our numbers began to slowly dwindle, and we started to realize that we wouldn't make it on our own! And so I sent for my childhood friend, Joris Nikannen, using magical and also more mundane messengers to relay our plight! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content04 Two weeks later, the orcs managed to break through our defenses and reach the inner court! The hour was dire and all able to bear arms were manning hastily erected barricades, as it was only a matter of time till the phalanx at the gate was worn down! And it was in that instance that Gromnir Stonefist and his mercenaries hit the enemy's rear! Fierce was his assault, but cunning too. A series of hit-and-run strikes from many directions, fireballs and lightning bolts exploding, and coming from what seemed like a thousand voices, war cries from known units of the Principality of Masgarth! The orcs thought the rescuers far more numerous than they were, and Captain Stonefist managed to strike hardest at the command group of the orcs, killing the blood shaman who was keeping the clans together. It broke their spirit! We had won, but the cost was great and the feeling in my mouth was mixed! Joris Nikannen saw it and found the words to shake me out of my gloom! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content05 "Ceannard, you think its grim, and it is! But believe me, being on the losing side would be even worse, as the orcs would have slaughtered or enslaved us all, down to the last babes!"\nCeannard the 8th - Chronicle of the Blood-Fang invasion

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Title On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Description An ancient-looking book, with the eight rings of the Arcaneum embossed into the cover. 
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01 On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02 As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03 It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04 In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05 The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01 …as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02 Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…

Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02 The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called "gods," and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content01 …deities of Tirmar are a source of a new and unknown kind of magic. The humans believe they are powerful entities, perhaps extraplanar in nature, whom they worship and whose commands they follow, receiving power in return.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content02 The humans are careful to distinguish between "good" and "evil" deities. "Good" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. "Evil" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say. Their arrival on Solasta…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Title The Time of the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Description An old book with the image of a dragon embossed on the cover.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01 There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02 Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being. The dragons feared them, and a great war ensued, pitting fire and magic against air and magic until the elves…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Title The Good Management of Servants
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Description An old book that seems to have been well-thumbed.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content01 The supreme duty of the head of a household is the management of servants. This is more important even than the welfare of the family, because a household can survive internal strife and injustice, but it cannot survive a breakdown in discipline. Heed well the lessons of history, and keep thoughts of revolt from the minds of your slaves.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02 Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute. It is not going too far, if you can afford it, to select one at random now and again for death by torture. As well as providing entertainment for your guests and an example for your children, this practice instils a healthy…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Plaque_Title Memorial Plaque
Equipment/&Abjuration_Plaque_Description A brass plaque on a wall.

This plaque was cast from brass melted in a furnace fueled by the bodies of their faithless slaves, both living and dead.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Title The Great War against the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Description An ancient book.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content01 The dragons saw how the elves were changing the world, bringing beauty to blasted volcanic wastes, and living green to barren fields of rock. They had never seen beauty before, nor heard music; their language was devoid of poetry, and their magic was brutal and without wonder.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02 The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03 Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded. It was in that bloody crucible that our people's mastery of magic was forged, and the elven race united under the first Emperor Ilmathir Ellanion.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content04 The war against the dragons lasted for three generations before the warrior Empress Cythaeriel Ellanion, the Lady of the Bright Blade, led the elves to…

Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Title Illusion and Substance: A Primer
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Description A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content01 …as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work "On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality," "Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content02 There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Title Human Gods and Their Magic
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Description A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content01 …exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content02 The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called "gods" or "deities," and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Title On Those Who Came from Tirmar
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Description A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content01 …humans and Sorr-Akkath are thought to be the only mortal beings to cross from Tirmar, the question of orcs and their kin must be taken into account. Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02 The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds.

Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!\n\nPlease bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a maximum level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. \n\nWe have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. \n\nConsidering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go and enjoy the game!

Their names: Khay, Annie, Betty, Arwin, Swen, Rhianna, and Hector.\nTogether, they were stronger than all the monsters of the Badlands.\nLong before the Copperhead Road was found, they knew the paths and tunnels from Masgarth to Manacalon.\nThey brought back an old book with teachings of how to enchant primed weapons, and sold it to a dwarf lord of the Gormsdottir clan. That was the start of it all. Soon, all eyes turned to the Badlands. The thirst for the forgotten secrets of the Old Empire was growing.\n\nThe rest is scribbled.

Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton02 You were still filling your diapers when I killed my first ghoul…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton03 I heard your stories. Not impressive.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton04 I know everyone in this city… and everyone knows me.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton05 You're still here? I'm sure there are some rats to kill in some cave somewhere.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton06 I know that look. Something happened… something bad.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton07 Don't get too cocky. These Soraks have more tricks up their sleeves.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton08 That crown's a trouble magnet, I can tell.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton09 Still alive? Good. There's more cleaning up to do.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton10 I'm better, sure. Doesn't mean I can't have a couple of beers…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton11 Well, I handled some unfinished business… feels good. I'm celebrating.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton12 If you're looking for a sharp blade… I’m your man.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton13 Any time, friends… I mean, any time after I finish this beer.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant01 I'm busy. Go see Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant02 We're packing - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant03 You want to buy something, ask Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant04 No time to chat - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard01 Keep out, strangers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard02 The Baron's waiting for you.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaptainIronshell01 Stay in the light, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyPCSpeech_TowerOfMagicJammedDoor This door is blocked… magically?
Narration/&Banter_Generic_01 Something's off.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_02 We should search the area carefully.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_03 Look at this place!
Narration/&Banter_Generic_04 Doesn't make any sense…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_01 Where did those goblins come from?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_02 Some hole in the mountain, I guess.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_03 What's that smell?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_04 Damn, it stinks…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_05 I wouldn't sleep here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_06 The Soraks can't be far away.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_07 We need to rest if we want to stand a chance against them.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_08 This place is so dark…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_09 That was fun.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_10 That was a long shot.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_11 We were so close.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_01 I can't believe Lisbath stayed behind…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_02 We're all gonna die…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_03 I'll have to tell the captain's wife.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_01 We should have left long ago…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_02 Leadership is what we need now.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_03 They won't get me without a fight.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_01 Up to my knees in the mud, nothing new here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_02 Shit food, shit shoes, business as usual.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_03 If we survive this I might drink myself to death.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_01 This place doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_02 In the Badlands… blah, blah…
Narration/&Banter_ToM_03 What happens if you fall down there?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_04 Wanna try?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_05 All these books floating around and I can't grab them.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_06 Are those webs?
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_01 Welcome, deputies!
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_02 Your rooms are ready.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_03 Good day, senior deputies.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_04 Clear skies… as they say!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_01 This place is so… wet.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_02 Feels like everything's dead around here…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_03 Well, it's dark, but at least it's not sewers anymore.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_04 Stay on your guard! We weren't invited here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_05 What's in all those bottles?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_06 I wouldn't set them on fire just to find out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_07 Smells like death.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_08 Is that a… pile of corpses? Gross!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_09 Someone here doesn't like the light of day.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_10 What kind of castle is that?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_11 Someone transformed it into a maze.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_12 Someone paranoid, you mean?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_13 We're going to die here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_14 There must a way be out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_15 Look for hints!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_16 It lost its mana, that's all.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_17 These arrows, they're not just random.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_18 Something's changed here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_19 That cannot be opened from here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_20 There must be a mechanism somewhere.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_21 I heard a mechanism.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_22 That opened something.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_23 This guy made it this far… maybe he found a hint.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_24 Another victim of the maze…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_25 Tell me we're not going back in there…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_26 So, no rune activated on that teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_27 I guess we need to reset the teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_28 I think we took a wrong turn.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_29 Hmm… four slabs for the four of us?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_30 And… no rune on that teleporter, either.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_31 I think this slab has triggered something!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_32 I heard some kind of mechanism!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Talbut Keep away from my home, strangers!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Anbgi Where's that damn femur?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_01 She's crazy…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_02 Shouldn't we go to Coparann?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_01 My beautiful river… broken and stained…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_02 The pull, the pull…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_03 Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_04 Are there dwarf kings now? Halfling kings too, maybe?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_05 That sounds… wrong.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_06 No slaves, no Gates…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_07 …this travel is exhausting.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_08 Humans don't look that bad.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_09 They smell a bit, though…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_10 This… town is really dirty.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_11 Is this Baron really a dwarf?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_12 I can't call a dwarf my lord, can I?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_13 He's rude. But he is a dwarf, after all.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_14 He is a nice dwarf.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_15 A halfling merchant? I almost didn't see him.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_01 Nice gardens.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_02 This place is magnificent.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_03 I never thought I'd get so close to the embassies.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_04 That's a view!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Trap_Detected_Self Wait! A trap!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Trap_Detected_Self Hold it! A trap!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Trap_Detected_Self I see a trap.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Secret_door_Detected_Self Look! A secret door!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Secret_door_Detected_Self There's a door, here.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Secret_door_Detected_Self I see a hidden door.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Trap_Trigerred_Self How did I miss that?
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Trap_Trigerred_Self It was just waiting for me!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Trap_Trigerred_Self I'm smarter than that!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Trap_Disarmed_Self Too easy!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Trap_Disarmed_Self I just needed one hand.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Trap_Disarmed_Self Piece of cake.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Light_up_Self Let there be light!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Light_up_Self That's better.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Light_up_Self A bit of light won't hurt.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Break_Stealth_Self Damn it!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Break_Stealth_Self That's on me.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Break_Stealth_Self What went wrong there?
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self How does that feel?
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Well deserved!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Take that!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Got you!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self You like it?
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Too slow!
PartyBanter/&Cynical4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self That must have hurt.
PartyBanter/&Cynical5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Touché!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Missed_Attack_Self Damn it!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Missed_Attack_Self What?
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Missed_Attack_Self I was sure…
PartyBanter/&Cynical4_Missed_Attack_Self How did I miss?
PartyBanter/&Cynical5_Missed_Attack_Self You're just lucky!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Kill_Enemy_Self And the winner is - me!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Kill_Enemy_Self You lose!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Kill_Enemy_Self Another victory!
PartyBanter/&Cynical4_Kill_Enemy_Self You never stood a chance!
PartyBanter/&Cynical5_Kill_Enemy_Self Another one bites the dust!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Healed_by_ally_Self I owe you one!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Healed_by_ally_Self I kind of liked that.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Healed_by_ally_Self Thanks, I feel better.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self No!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self Hold on!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self We need you!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Trap_Trigerred_Other Looks like you found something.
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Trap_Trigerred_Other Really? You didn't see that?
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Trap_Trigerred_Other Only a fool would… oh, wait.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Trap_Disarmed_Other This was clearly broken already.
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Trap_Disarmed_Other Just lucky, I guess.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Trap_Disarmed_Other Well! You're not completely useless after all!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Long_Jump_Other You're not too rusty.
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Long_Jump_Other Easy on your ankles!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Long_Jump_Other Artistic note - not great.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_High_Climb_Other Nice little warm-up.
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_High_Climb_Other I know kids who'd do that faster.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_High_Climb_Other A real little goblin.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Break_Stealth_Other Did we not say "silent"?
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Break_Stealth_Other I thought we said "cautious."
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Break_Stealth_Other Can't say I'm surprised.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Pushing_Heavy_Other Heave ho!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Pushing_Heavy_Other Come on - push!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Crawling_Other You don't mind being on your knees, do you?
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Crawling_Other Looks like you've been doing that all your life.
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other Hold it!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other Stay with us!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other Are you okay?
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other You've seen worse!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other That's the way!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Nice!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Impressive!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Nice move!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Again!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Good!
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Missed_Attack_Other Come on, you can do better!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Missed_Attack_Other Try again!
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Missed_Attack_Other Another miss?
PartyBanter/&Cynical1_Kill_Enemy_Other Hey! That was mine!
PartyBanter/&Cynical2_Kill_Enemy_Other That one didn't even fight back.
PartyBanter/&Cynical3_Kill_Enemy_Other Not too bad.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Detected_Self Damn! A trap!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Detected_Self Stop! A trap!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Detected_Self There's a trap!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Secret_door_Detected_Self Hey - a secret door!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Secret_door_Detected_Self Found a door, here!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Secret_door_Detected_Self We have a hidden door!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Trigerred_Self Crap!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Trigerred_Self Damn it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Trigerred_Self I hate those!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Disarmed_Self Easy.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Disarmed_Self Piece of junk.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Disarmed_Self Done and done.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Light_up_Self I needed that.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Light_up_Self Light, at last.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Light_up_Self Light, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Break_Stealth_Self Damn!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Break_Stealth_Self No!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Break_Stealth_Self Clumsy idiot!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Bleed!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Die!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self You like that?
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Take that!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Wait till the next one!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self More coming your way.
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self You'll die like the rest!
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self No quarter given!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Missed_Attack_Self Damn!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Missed_Attack_Self No!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Missed_Attack_Self Come on!
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Missed_Attack_Self I won't miss next time!
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Missed_Attack_Self You'll die anyway!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Kill_Enemy_Self I win again.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Kill_Enemy_Self You lose.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Kill_Enemy_Self Go to hell!
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Kill_Enemy_Self You're not coming back.
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Kill_Enemy_Self You didn't get me.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Healed_by_ally_Self Thanks.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Healed_by_ally_Self I'll remember.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Healed_by_ally_Self I owe you one.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self Come on! 
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self Don't let me down!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self No!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Trigerred_Other What an idiot!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Trigerred_Other Open your damn eyes!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Trigerred_Other Pay attention!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Disarmed_Other Well done!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Disarmed_Other One less problem.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Disarmed_Other I hate those!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Long_Jump_Other That was something!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Long_Jump_Other Nice jump!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Long_Jump_Other Well done!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_High_Climb_Other Good arms you got!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_High_Climb_Other Didn't think you could do it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_High_Climb_Other Okay, you're tough.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Break_Stealth_Other Clumsy!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Break_Stealth_Other I don't believe it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Break_Stealth_Other You'll get us all killed!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Pushing_Heavy_Other Come on, harder!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Pushing_Heavy_Other Push!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Crawling_Other Dive in the dirt, now.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Crawling_Other Crawling through dirt - nothing new here.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other You'll get a nice scar!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other If it doesn't kill you…
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other Walk it off!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other Deal with it!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other That's the way!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Kill 'em all!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Crush 'em!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Again! Harder!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other More!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other That's battle!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Missed_Attack_Other You suck!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Missed_Attack_Other Stop that!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Missed_Attack_Other I thought you could fight!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Kill_Enemy_Other That, I like!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Kill_Enemy_Other Keep 'em coming!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Kill_Enemy_Other Good kill!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Detected_Self Hold it - I see a trap!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Detected_Self Everybody freeze!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Detected_Self Wait! I see a trap.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Secret_door_Detected_Self Friends! There's a hidden door here!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Secret_door_Detected_Self Look at that - a secret door!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Secret_door_Detected_Self Thought I'd miss you, eh?
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Trigerred_Self No!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Trigerred_Self Sorry for that!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Trigerred_Self I'm such an idiot!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Disarmed_Self That wasn't so bad.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Disarmed_Self I think I did it.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Disarmed_Self Mission accomplished.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Light_up_Self The Light is with us.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Light_up_Self The Light will guide us.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Light_up_Self We bring light in darkness!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Break_Stealth_Self Oops!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Break_Stealth_Self Sorry!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Break_Stealth_Self I know, I know!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Surrender or die!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self I take no prisoners!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self I will kill you.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Bend the knee or perish!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Run while you can!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self You can't win!
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self I am unbeatable!
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self You cannot defeat me!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Missed_Attack_Self Damn!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Missed_Attack_Self Come on!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Missed_Attack_Self I must do better!
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Missed_Attack_Self I'm getting the measure of this!
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Missed_Attack_Self Next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Kill_Enemy_Self Once more, we prevail!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Kill_Enemy_Self Another victory! This is destiny!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Kill_Enemy_Self You were doomed.
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Kill_Enemy_Self You should have fled.
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Kill_Enemy_Self You should have yielded.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Healed_by_ally_Self I'm in your debt, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Healed_by_ally_Self I will not forget this.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Healed_by_ally_Self I owe you my life.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self Hold on to life, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self We won't let you die!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self We leave no one behind!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Trigerred_Other Closer attention required, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Trigerred_Other You're lacking focus.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Trigerred_Other A little bit of caution here, please?
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Disarmed_Other Good work!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Disarmed_Other Well done, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Disarmed_Other Your skills are impressive!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Long_Jump_Other What a fantastic leap!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Long_Jump_Other You have trained well!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Long_Jump_Other I'm impressed!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_High_Climb_Other That's impressive.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_High_Climb_Other You're impressively fit.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_High_Climb_Other I underestimated you. My apologies!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Break_Stealth_Other That wasn't smart.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Break_Stealth_Other You'll need to do better than that!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Break_Stealth_Other More caution next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Pushing_Heavy_Other With all your might!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Pushing_Heavy_Other You can do it!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Crawling_Other Sometimes there is simply no choice.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Crawling_Other I don't like it either.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other Courage!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other You're still standing!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other You can take it!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other Shake it off!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other That's the way!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Masterful!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other You'll surely prevail!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Well struck!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Perfect!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Go on!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Missed_Attack_Other Better luck next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Missed_Attack_Other Don't lose hope!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Missed_Attack_Other Just bad luck!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Kill_Enemy_Other Victory is yours!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Kill_Enemy_Other Impressive move, my friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Kill_Enemy_Other Nobody has your skills, bravo!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Detected_Self A crude trap.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Detected_Self We won't be fooled so easily.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Detected_Self I spotted a trap of sorts.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Secret_door_Detected_Self I believe there is a hidden door.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Secret_door_Detected_Self This has to be a secret passage.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Secret_door_Detected_Self Interesting - a secret door.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Trigerred_Self How foolish of me!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Trigerred_Self How could I miss it?
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Trigerred_Self I really must be more careful.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Disarmed_Self That was simplicity itself!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Disarmed_Self Not as taxing as I expected.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Disarmed_Self Ingenious, but not unbeatable.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Light_up_Self A little light is always welcome.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Light_up_Self Let there be light!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Light_up_Self Blessed are the Lightbringers!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Break_Stealth_Self Curses! My fault.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Break_Stealth_Self I really thought I… never mind.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Break_Stealth_Self How tiresome.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Hah! Take that, you fiend!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Just where it hurts most!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self Death reaches out for you!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Not bad, eh?
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self A modest success!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self A palpable hit!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self Lucky? Perhaps.
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self I trained hard for this!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Missed_Attack_Self Fortune is fickle!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Missed_Attack_Self Most unfortunate, that.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Missed_Attack_Self Only the last blow matters!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Missed_Attack_Self Next time, I swear…
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Missed_Attack_Self I'll get you yet!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Kill_Enemy_Self One foe down!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Kill_Enemy_Self Death claims you!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Kill_Enemy_Self Victory is mine!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Kill_Enemy_Self A victory fit for a song!
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Kill_Enemy_Self Another victory!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Healed_by_ally_Self You are a true savior.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Healed_by_ally_Self You are a valued comrade.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Healed_by_ally_Self I am in your debt, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self The fight is not yet over!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self Your comrades will save you!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self We are coming!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Trigerred_Other Tsk. An elementary mistake.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Trigerred_Other Watch your step, friend!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Trigerred_Other A dangerous error.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Disarmed_Other Perfectly executed!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Disarmed_Other My congratulations on a job well done.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Disarmed_Other Your skill is impressive.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Long_Jump_Other An extraordinary jump!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Long_Jump_Other Most impressive!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Long_Jump_Other Such athleticism!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_High_Climb_Other What strength!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_High_Climb_Other It seems effortless!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_High_Climb_Other Clearly you have trained well.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Break_Stealth_Other Even the dead could hear you!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Break_Stealth_Other Of course you've been detected!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Break_Stealth_Other Perhaps if you tried to be loud, instead?
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Pushing_Heavy_Other You can do it!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Pushing_Heavy_Other Heave, now - all your strength!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Crawling_Other Undignified, but necessary.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Crawling_Other Kneel now, rise later.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other Are you still with us?
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other That was a lucky hit!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other Hold firm - you've endured worse!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other You're still in the fight, my friend!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other A telling blow!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other A fine stroke!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other Truly formidable!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Well struck!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other Well done!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other You have them now!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Missed_Attack_Other Oh! Bad luck!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Missed_Attack_Other Next time!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Missed_Attack_Other Try again!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Kill_Enemy_Other Bravo! Victory is yours!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Kill_Enemy_Other A good kill, as they say.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Kill_Enemy_Other One less enemy!
Narration/&LoreTrailer01 Before the Cataclysm, there were no Gods on Solasta.
Narration/&LoreTrailer02 No humans, either.
Narration/&LoreTrailer03 Then the rift opened.
Narration/&LoreTrailer04 Some say it was a magical accident... 
Narration/&LoreTrailer05 ...or the work of an evil god.
Narration/&LoreTrailer06 No one knows for sure.
Narration/&LoreTrailer07 The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire
Narration/&LoreTrailer08 - Manacalon, they called it -
Narration/&LoreTrailer09 and twisted the land beyond recognition.
Narration/&LoreTrailer10 Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures.
Narration/&LoreTrailer11 But something is happening, deep in those Badlands.
Narration/&LoreTrailer12 Whatever it is,
Narration/&LoreTrailer13 it can't be good.
Narration/&TelemaArrivingTitle Entering Telema
Narration/&Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter So these are the ruins of Telema?
Narration/&Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard Just as the chronicles describe them!
Narration/&Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard Imagine the wonders that await us inside!
Narration/&Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric Don't forget... we're here to help the Scavengers.
Narration/&Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue And get rich, right?
Narration/&Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue Help the Scavengers and get rich.
Narration/&Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter You're all heart, aren't you?
Narration/&Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric That must be their camp over there.
Narration/&Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric Come on, let's go.
Narration/&TelemaMeetingScavsTitle The Scavengers Camp
Narration/&Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena Who goes there?
Narration/&Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter Friends!
Narration/&Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric Runnel sent us.
Narration/&Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek Where is he?
Narration/&Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric Resting... he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay.
Narration/&Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric He said you need help.
Narration/&Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek We did. If only you'd come sooner... .
Narration/&Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice What happened?
Narration/&Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer We came as soon as we could. What happened?
Narration/&Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena We know... and thanks.
Narration/&Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena Dek here is upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice We're here now.
Narration/&Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer Well we're here now. How can we help?
Narration/&Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice We could go back.
Narration/&Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back.
Narration/&Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek Yes, well, maybe you should!
Narration/&Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!
Narration/&Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena We can't leave Hector in there.
Narration/&Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek He's dead, Lena... dead! It's too late!
Narration/&Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena You don't know that!
Narration/&Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice Calm down.
Narration/&Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer Calm down, now. This won't help.
Narration/&Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice We'll help you.
Narration/&Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer It's all right... we're here to help you.
Narration/&Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice Amazing.
Narration/&Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs some trouble?
Narration/&Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue What's our help worth to you, anyway?
Narration/&Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter Stop it!
Narration/&Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena Alright.
Narration/&Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena What did Runnel tell you?
Narration/&Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter Just that his team needed help... nothing else.
Narration/&Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena We were scavenging in the ruins, and -
Narration/&Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!
Narration/&Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena It was just a raiding party.
Narration/&Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena We fought them off... 
Narration/&Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena ... but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off.
Narration/&Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job.
Narration/&Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter They haven't done that yet, though.
Narration/&Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue Well, you're right about your friend... 
Narration/&Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue ... he must be dead by now.
Narration/&Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric We don't know that. There is always hope.
Narration/&Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night.
Narration/&Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard I don't know... they took him alive, after all... .
Narration/&Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue So they wanted to keep him fresh... orcs are orcs!
Narration/&Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?
Narration/&Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek Yeah... good luck with that!
Narration/&Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric Why is he so angry?
Narration/&Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena He and Hector don't exactly get along.
Narration/&Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena But he's one of our crew... 
Narration/&Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena ... and I won't leave anyone behind.
Narration/&Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric We gave our word to your leaders.
Narration/&Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric We will get Hector back.
Narration/&Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena Thanks.
Narration/&Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena Do you need food?
Narration/&Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter You think we'll be away for that long?
Narration/&Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena You can never be too careful... 
Narration/&Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena ... that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena We can spare some if you need it.
Narration/&Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena We have more than we need for just the two of us.
Narration/&Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek Are you serious?
Narration/&Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek You're giving away our food?
Narration/&Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena They're risking their lives for us, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek For Hector. We can starve, apparently.
Narration/&Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter Get it?
Narration/&Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess I don't believe it.
Narration/&Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess That's on you, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess Don't worry,
Narration/&Telema_91_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess that's just the way he is.
Narration/&Telema_92_MeetingScavs_Clericchecksuccess Thanks, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_93_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed No.
Narration/&Telema_94_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed Nice try.
Narration/&Telema_95_MeetingScavs_Fightercheckfailed Shut up.
Narration/&Telema_96_MeetingScavs_Fighter We should get moving and find your friend.
Narration/&Telema_97_MeetingScavs_Lena Thanks!
Narration/&Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena And good luck!
Narration/&Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion You're right... keep your food.
Narration/&Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion You're right... keep it. We'll survive.
Narration/&Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric We'll be back in no time.
Narration/&Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric If not, you'll have enough to eat.
Narration/&Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess Don't look at me.
Narration/&Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess Just one day of food, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess All right, take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess Thank you!
Narration/&Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed Absolutely.
Narration/&Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice Your boss said you'd feed us.
Narration/&Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed.
Narration/&Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek Did he?
Narration/&Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue Are you calling me a liar?
Narration/&Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess No.
Narration/&Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess So?
Narration/&Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess So take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed Why not?
Narration/&Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed Fair enough.
Narration/&Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed Impressive negotiation skills.
Narration/&Telema_118_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed He's stubborn, that's all.
Narration/&TelemaBasReliefTitle A Sight for Sore Eyes
Narration/&Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard Perfectly preserved!
Narration/&Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric What is it?
Narration/&Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces.
Narration/&Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times.
Narration/&Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!
Narration/&Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric The old Empire was built on slavery and racism.
Narration/&Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson.
Narration/&Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue Now... does this look valuable to you?
Narration/&Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard All history is valuable, my friend.
Narration/&Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue Tell that to my purse.
Narration/&Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out.
Narration/&TelemaChestTitle Too good to be True
Narration/&Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter Well, that's interesting.
Narration/&Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue You don't say! Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter I'd be careful if I were you.
Narration/&Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter It looks too good to be true.
Narration/&Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue That's right. You can't be too careful... 
Narration/&Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue ... that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&TelemaStatueTitle Memory of the Past
Narration/&Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue Try not to stare... you're making that statue uncomfortable.
Narration/&Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard But it's... can you read this?
Narration/&Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin... I mean, education.
Narration/&Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric That's emperor Gildean the Third.
Narration/&Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue How do you know?
Narration/&Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric It's written here.
Narration/&Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric For those who can read it.
Narration/&Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue That's nice for you, I'm sure.
Narration/&Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard His was a very ancient dynasty.
Narration/&Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard Look at his date of birth.
Narration/&Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric And location.
Narration/&Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard Wait! I must copy this.
Narration/&Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard The Tower will find this interesting.
Narration/&Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter Are you done?
Narration/&TelemaDoorTitle Dead End?
Narration/&Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue Can we open it?
Narration/&Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter I don't see how.
Narration/&Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard Must be magically sealed.
Narration/&Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?
Narration/&Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter In the Badlands, anything's possible.
Narration/&Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue Do you have a spell to open it?
Narration/&Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard No.
Narration/&Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter Let's not waste time, then. Move out!
Narration/&Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue They must have gone through here after they took Hector.
Narration/&Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric Really? We need to crawl through there?
Narration/&Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?
Narration/&Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric Very funny.
Narration/&Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter I see light ahead!
Narration/&Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor.
Narration/&Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter Be careful!
Narration/&Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue Law of the Badlands, my friend.
Narration/&TelemaBackFromReconTitle Meeting the Locals
Narration/&Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue The orcs are here.
Narration/&Telema_169_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue Looks like we can sneak around.
Narration/&Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter Even me?
Narration/&Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue Ehh... probably.
Narration/&Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric Did you see Hector?
Narration/&Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue Not a trace.
Narration/&Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter We should attack... we have the element of surprise.
Narration/&Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric But what if Hector's down there too?
Narration/&Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with.
Narration/&Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue Not these orcs.
Narration/&TelemaOrcCampExitTitle Disappointment...
Narration/&Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter So, no Hector?
Narration/&Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard It doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric Maybe he's further down.
Narration/&Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter All right, let's keep looking.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle Lighting the Darkness
Narration/&Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter I don't like this.
Narration/&Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue We can climb down.
Narration/&Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard It's too dark.
Narration/&Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute.
Narration/&Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling.
Narration/&Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard Maybe we can use it to light up the place.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalExitTitle No Way Back
Narration/&Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue Damn it! Now we're stuck!
Narration/&Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?
Narration/&Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard Not the orcs, no... 
Narration/&Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard ... but something else... maybe.
Narration/&Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter We've come this far... let's find him.
Narration/&Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue I'm starting to think we might need that food after all.
Narration/&TelemaShaftEntranceTitle Unexpected Denizens
Narration/&Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric What is this... an amphitheater?
Narration/&Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard A very special one.
Narration/&Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue Not room for much of a crowd... .
Narration/&Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here.
Narration/&Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter Do spiders like magic shows?
Narration/&Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter Because I see a lot of webs.
Narration/&Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard Deep spiders. We will have to be careful.
Narration/&Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter Deep spiders?
Narration/&Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light.
Narration/&Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue Just how large is very large?
Narration/&Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard Just keep your lights ready... .
Narration/&Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard ... and your oil handy.
Narration/&Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face.
Narration/&Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up.
Narration/&TelemaShaftUpperTitle A way out?
Narration/&Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter How many are there?
Narration/&Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue You don't want to know.
Narration/&Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric Try pushing this down!
Narration/&Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric I feel a weakness here.
Narration/&TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle Escape... to Hector!
Narration/&Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard Well done!
Narration/&Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue You sure they're dead?
Narration/&Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter Well, they're not coming back.
Narration/&Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue Good.
Narration/&Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric My friends, I believe I have found Hector.
Narration/&Telema_217_Rescue_Hector By all the gods at once... thank you!
Narration/&Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter Are you Hector?
Narration/&Telema_219_Rescue_Hector Yes! And you?
Narration/&Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter The boss sent us. Ronnel went for help.
Narration/&Telema_221_Rescue_Hector Runnel! So he survived?
Narration/&Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric Barely, but yes.
Narration/&Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric He's safely back in town.
Narration/&Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue So, did the spiders take you?
Narration/&Telema_225_Rescue_Hector The orcs did, after their raid.
Narration/&Telema_226_Rescue_Hector They kept me for a while.
Narration/&Telema_227_Rescue_Hector I was wondering why.
Narration/&Telema_228_Rescue_Hector I finally got the answer when they... 
Narration/&Telema_229_Rescue_Hector ... well, they sacrificied me.
Narration/&Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter What?
Narration/&Telema_231_Rescue_Hector They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves.
Narration/&Telema_232_Rescue_Hector They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater.
Narration/&Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue Oh, that one?
Narration/&Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue We kind of... destroyed it.
Narration/&Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter The spider nest, too.
Narration/&Telema_236_Rescue_Hector Interesting.
Narration/&Telema_237_Rescue_Hector I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that.
Narration/&Telema_238_Rescue_Hector This spider cult seemed important to them.
Narration/&Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter Can't say I feel sorry for them.
Narration/&Telema_240_Rescue_Hector I owe you my life. Thanks again.
Narration/&Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric You are most welcome.
Narration/&Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter You should rest, and I think we should do the same.
Narration/&Telema_243_Rescue_Hector Good idea.
Narration/&Telema_244_Rescue_Choice What's your story?
Narration/&Telema_245_Rescue_Answer So Hector, what's your story?
Narration/&Telema_246_Rescue_Hector Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really.
Narration/&Telema_247_Rescue_Hector I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_248_Rescue_Choice What about Lena and Dek?
Narration/&Telema_249_Rescue_Answer Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!
Narration/&Telema_250_Rescue_Hector Oh, those two... always fighting over something.
Narration/&Telema_251_Rescue_Hector But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to.
Narration/&Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter They seemed pretty much at each other's throats.
Narration/&Telema_253_Rescue_Hector Yeah, like I said... always fighting.
Narration/&Telema_254_Rescue_Hector But in battle, always back to back.
Narration/&Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue Aww... that's so sweet.
Narration/&Telema_256_Rescue_Choice Did you find anything good in here?
Narration/&Telema_257_Rescue_Answer Did you find anything good in the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_258_Rescue_Hector No, not much. You've seen the state of the place... 
Narration/&Telema_259_Rescue_Hector ... but there was something.
Narration/&Telema_260_Rescue_Hector Didn't have time to use it.
Narration/&Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter What is it?
Narration/&Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue A key?
Narration/&Telema_263_Rescue_Hector I think it opens the door in the ruins.
Narration/&Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue Oh, yeah... that door.
Narration/&Telema_265_Rescue_Hector At least, I hope it does.
Narration/&Telema_266_Rescue_Hector Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all.
Narration/&Telema_267_Rescue_Choice You're a cleric of Einar?
Narration/&Telema_268_Rescue_Answer You're wearing the flaming sword.
Narration/&Telema_269_Rescue_Hector And I can see you're from the order of the Beacon.
Narration/&Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric Are you a priest, Hector?
Narration/&Telema_271_Rescue_Hector Just a humble follower.
Narration/&Telema_272_Rescue_Hector This was given to me by one of your brothers.
Narration/&Telema_273_Rescue_Hector We fought together... he felt like he owed me.
Narration/&Telema_274_Rescue_Hector And he gave me this.
Narration/&Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter I think we're all ready to go.
Narration/&Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard Indeed.
Narration/&Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric I think we're close to the surface.
Narration/&Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric I can feel it.
Narration/&Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter All right... let's move.
Narration/&Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter Orcs! Over there!
Narration/&Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue It's an ambush!
Narration/&Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter Time to fight!
Narration/&Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter Hey! Take a look at this.
Narration/&Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric The stone is carved.
Narration/&Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter Are we back near the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric It looks fragile, let's try pushing it.
Narration/&Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter Well done... we're back in the ruins!
Narration/&Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue So, do you still have that key?
Narration/&Telema_289_WayBack_Hector Sure.
Narration/&Telema_290_WayBack_Hector Take it.
Narration/&Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard Amazing!
Narration/&Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard This room hasn't been opened in a millenium!
Narration/&Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric Those books are falling into pieces.
Narration/&Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard Not this one!
Narration/&Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric Look around for other valuables.
Narration/&Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue Already doing it!
Narration/&Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena Hey! Here they are!
Narration/&Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek I'll be damned... they're alive!
Narration/&Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter We told you we'd find him.
Narration/&Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena Hector?
Narration/&Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek Lena, wait!
Narration/&Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric What's going on?
Narration/&Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena That's not Hector!
Narration/&Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter What?
Narration/&Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue Then just who are you, friend?
Narration/&Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector Put down your weapons.
Narration/&Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter Why would we do that?
Narration/&Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining.
Narration/&Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here.
Narration/&Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?
Narration/&Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default Here for the Council job? Join the club. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative If you're here for the Council job, get in line.
Narration/&Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him.
Narration/&Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly Grab a chair. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default Looks like you've been waiting here a while.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal I see you're all making the best of this.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?
Narration/&Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?
Narration/&Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?
Narration/&Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal Well, I was making my way here… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal …when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal They dragged me off to some decrepit prison… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal …and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss.
Narration/&Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang Well, I was heading down a lonely road… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang …when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang …and threw my ass in this rundown jail.
Narration/&Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there.
Narration/&Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal I was heading down the highway, minding my own business…
Narration/&Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal …when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me.
Narration/&Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal They carried me off to some ramshackle prison.
Narration/&Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal An Imperial ruin of some sort… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking.
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal …Don't know what was holding the place up… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang …a strong wind coulda taken it down.
Narration/&Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear.
Narration/&Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!
Narration/&Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be.
Narration/&Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience.
Narration/&Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready.
Narration/&Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain.
Narration/&Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?
Narration/&Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy.
Narration/&Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told.
Narration/&Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!
Narration/&Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal I don't remember anyone asking your opinion.
Narration/&Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!
Narration/&Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky.
Narration/&Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!
Narration/&Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger.
Narration/&Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical Everyone's a critic.
Narration/&Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures.
Narration/&Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default Aren't all drunks basically stupid?
Narration/&Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default …I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal What?
Narration/&Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang Bullshit!
Narration/&Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal That is preposterous.
Narration/&Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal High in the hills, two days west of here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal I left the main road to find a shorter way through… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal And I was making good time… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal …when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave.
Narration/&Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang …and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut.
Narration/&Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang …and fell right into a blasted hole.
Narration/&Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal …hoping to save time by traversing the hills.
Narration/&Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path.
Narration/&Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs.
Narration/&Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters.
Narration/&Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell.
Narration/&Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default Orcs have a very distinctive stink.
Narration/&Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger.
Narration/&Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful We should bill the Council for all this wasted time.
Narration/&Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us.
Narration/&Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business.
Narration/&Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!
Narration/&Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?
Narration/&Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default Fine - you want to know the truth?
Narration/&Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine… 
Narration/&Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark.
Narration/&Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal Oh, that's not good.
Narration/&Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang Sounds like an idiot.
Narration/&Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal So he was in dire straits?
Narration/&Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it.
Narration/&Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary. 
Narration/&Tavern_041_Carran_NPC Are you four here to see Lord Carran?
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN We're not here to get drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN Who's asking?
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN Maybe we're here looking for a fight.
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic Depends on who's asking.
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC Well, thank you for making that clear…
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_NPC Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN So you're real, then?
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN We're ready.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN We should get paid for waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical So you're not a mythical creature after all.
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful Then we are here at your service, sir.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful Very good.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh.
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal Can you tell us more about the job?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord.
Narration/&Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing. 
Narration/&Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC What do you want to know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN About the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN About the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN Are you our employer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN We're good, thank you.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio We should be going, don't you think?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01 We don't exactly have the time…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02 …anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03 We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04 …through a pass called the Copperhead Road.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05 We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06 Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07 While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08 …though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice Are we going to work for you?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01 Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02 That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01 Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02 I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03 The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04 It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN What are the Badlands?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice What are the Badlands, really?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01 Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02 It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03 Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN What are the Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01 Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02 The Snow Alliance lies to the north.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03 The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04 And the New Empire, to the south.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05 All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN What organizations are there?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice What are the organizations you mentioned?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01 The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02 Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03 Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04 And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN We know enough.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice I think we know enough now. Thank you!
Narration/&Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC Very well.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_NPC Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in.
Narration/&Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful Whose fault is that? 
Narration/&Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical Hurry up and wait. The story of my life.
Narration/&Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_FindTools Liam… always thoughtful.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01 There you are, you filthy crook!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02 Think you scare me? Not anymore!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2 A grave mistake.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal Ow! That's going to leave a mark.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang Damn! That hurt like hell.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs There they are… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal …if they see me, I'm dead.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal …discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang …head down, or I'm next on the menu.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal No other means of egress is apparent.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable.
Narration/&Council_00_1_Wow_Default Look at this size of this Council hall!
Narration/&Council_00_2_Wow_Default A very impressive edifice indeed.
Narration/&Council_00_3_joker_Default So this is what they spend our taxes on.
Narration/&Council_00_4_Any_Default Look! Is that… 
Narration/&Council_00_5_Any_Default The Princess!
Narration/&Council_00_6_Any_Default Wait… is she leaving?
Narration/&Council_00_7_joker_Default Apparently so… 
Narration/&Council_00_8_Any_Default Then who will administer the oath?
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN The maid who empties her chamber pot?
Narration/&Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN We're too low for her.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN It's not her role.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Slang A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think.
Narration/&Council_00_10_Carran_NPC You thought it would be the Princess? 
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN She doesn't rule the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN If not her, then who?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default Doesn't she lead the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate.
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02 Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all.
Narration/&Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council_00_16_Carran_NPC Yes, m'lady!
Narration/&Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC Are these your new deputies?
Narration/&Council_00_18_Carran_NPC They are, m'lady.
Narration/&Council_00_19_Serious_Default Very well. Pay attention. All of you.
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Slang Pipe down. 
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Normal Shhh, quiet everyone!
Narration/&Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council.
Narration/&Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC And I will be administering your vows.
Narration/&Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go.
Narration/&Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always.
Narration/&Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC Now, please, raise your right hands.
Narration/&Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise… 
Narration/&Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC …to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&Council_00_30_Carran_NPC Congratulations, deputies.
Narration/&Council_00_31_Any_Default Wait, that's it?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN You were expecting a parade?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN That was long enough.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN Let's focus on the mission.
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Default What were you expecting? A parade? 
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Slang Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?
Narration/&Council_00_33_Any_Default I suppose you imagined something more pompous.
Narration/&Council_00_34_Any_Default No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic.
Narration/&Council_00_35_Carran_NPC Sorry to disappoint. 
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01 The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02 But more would probably be… immodest.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice Stop wasting time! What's the mission?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran Well! A motivated deputy.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Carran_NPC So - the mission:
Narration/&Council_00_44_Carran_NPC As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts… 
Narration/&Council_00_45_Carran_NPC …to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches.
Narration/&Council_00_46_Carran_NPC One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council_00_47_Carran_NPC It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_48_Carran_NPC He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to.
Narration/&Council_00_49_Carran_NPC We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks.
Narration/&Council_00_50_Carran_NPC Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive.
Narration/&Council_00_51_Carran_NPC If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back.
Narration/&Council_00_52_Carran_NPC The Council wants a first-hand report.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN Sounds dangerous.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN Wait - you spoke of the Marches?
Narration/&Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN Tell us about Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN We're good to go.
Narration/&Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us.
Narration/&Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01 Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Normal Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Slang We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger.
Narration/&Council_00_59_Carran_NPC You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Carran_NPC So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence.
Narration/&Council_00_60_Marches_Choice Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?
Narration/&Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01 The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02 It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03 We wouldn't send you in there… yet.
Narration/&Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?
Narration/&Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01 A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army.
Narration/&Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02 He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Any_Default Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC Hello! How may I help you?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN What do you sell?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN Can we see your wares?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default What do you sell here?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC Come back any time - I'm almost always open!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN What do you sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN Can we see your wares?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC That's me! The one and only.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default What do you have to sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC …food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins. 
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC Hello, adventurers!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC What can I offer you?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN Tell us about this place.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN Your beer tastes bad.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN We need a room.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN Goodbye.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any We should go.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default Tell us about your tavern.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC We also have rooms to rent by the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC Maybe your palate is not refined enough.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default We'd like to stay for the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default A suite? 
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay No money, eh. No room, then. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye Stay in the light, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC Deputies? A word, if you please.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default So famous already? I love it!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC We don't have a seat in there, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC …they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC You'll need our services, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default Is that… compulsory?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC Did lord Carran not tell you?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC Of course you are. Well, good luck!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default At least she's not another lady or something.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default I'd rather visit the temple, honestly.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default It's not far, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC Ah - you came!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC You don't know? Tsk.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN What help do you offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN Do you know Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN See you later.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default What kind of help do you offer to people like us?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC …in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default Who's Captain Merran?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC …well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC And stop interrupting! It's rude.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC …too much for you to lug back here.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC …we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default For a percentage, of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC What? You could never carry it all, anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC Not in your little backpacks.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC Of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default That's it?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC Merton… it's a painful topic for me. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC I'd rather not talk about him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default Fair enough.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC No, we don't. There's a shop for that.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC However…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC We've got something even better.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default Here we go again…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default That's not cheap, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default Are there others?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC Anywhere we can settle. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default In what?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC In getting our people to Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default Right, we'll tell him if we find him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC That would be appreciated. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC The more you do for us, the more we do for you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC And I hope it will, friend.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default I guess we'll see you around, then.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag So that's Caer Lem?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag We're almost there… it's just up the hill.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag It's a little too quiet, don't you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal True. Let's keep our eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal Quite so. We must be on our guard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal Who put you in charge?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang Don't play the captain with me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal I'm just saying, be ready for anything.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang Damn right. Let's get on with it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal All right. Let's just keep going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal Agreed. We should press on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal There's no one here. Not even corpses.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag Look! That tower… that's insane!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang Courtesy of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal Well, that's not a good sign.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal Does this tell us anything we don't already know?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag There's definitely been fighting here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React This is no time for jokes.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal Did you see that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang What the heck was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default Someone's hiding inside the tower.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default We need to get up to that door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC Back off! No closer!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default Who's there?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC We're not letting you in!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC And we're not coming out!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC They'll cast a spell on you!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC Don't touch me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal Is something not right in there, or is it just me?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang Lost their minds, the lot of 'em.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default …we can show them our Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC You damn Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default Did they say Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN We're Council deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN Use spy call phrase
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN Use sellsword experience
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN Be reasonable!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck Open the damn door, there are only four of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck They have Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC What?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default What was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default Just fishing. Give it a moment.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC Magic pillows give us sweet dreams.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC Sandreed, eh? Which unit?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC What happened to "don't talk to them"?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC Open up… they're not Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC Exactly what a Sorak would say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC Fine with me. Daliat, open the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC No! I said no!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC Close the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default Thank you for letting us in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC Don't thank me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN Are you the officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN You thought we were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN Can we talk to the others?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default Are you in charge here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC Second in command… After Captain Henrik.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC Man-sized lizards that can speak? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC Oh, yeah… they're real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC But we found no corpses… nothing.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC So no one can prove they exist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN That's awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN That's hard to believe.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN That's garbage.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal No proof… that's kind of awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang Course they did… just to make you look crazy.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC You won't laugh when they come back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default We got here without trouble.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default Why would they do that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC How should I know? They're Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang Mind if we talk to your buddies?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default I might have a better chance with this guy… alone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default I don't like being kept in the dark.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default He looks like any other beggar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default Come on, trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default What exactly is it between you and him?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default We trust you to do what's best for us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default Leave the goddess out of this, will you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default If you do then, please, be our guest.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC How do you know the code?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC We'll see.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default So… Soraks? Really?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC Even hiding their bodies is in the stories.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default Think they're still around?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC Possibly.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default Any idea what they're after?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default Right. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default They'll want to talk to you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC Fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default He's all yours.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default So who are you, friend?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC Daliat Sunbird, scout.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default Do you believe they were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC Dunno. Seemed real, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default What do you think they wanted? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC To kill us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal Not big on talk, eh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal You seem a very reluctant conversationalist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC I'm gonna rest now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC Nice man.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default How about you? Did you learn anything?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default So much for your secret code.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default Sorry to disappoint.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC Now it's my turn, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default What do you mean?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC What is this? A murder investigation?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN Should it be?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN Just trying to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default Should we be investigating?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC Maybe. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal You've said too much to stop now. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal Speak up, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal Go on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang Spit it out.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal Speak up without fear, friend.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC Found a ruin, came back with loot. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC The next day, this happens. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC Coincidence? You tell me. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default The scouts, you say?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC Only one of them's still alive.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default Right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default We just want to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC Good luck with that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default You sound worried. Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN Sorry.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN You're hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN Go to hell.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default No offense intended.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default I'll take that as a yes. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default I don't like to be insulted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default You go to hell, you spineless moron.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC You should work on your manners, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC And I don't like to be accused of… whatever. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN We started on the wrong foot.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN Speak up, or else!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN We know there's a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default Get lost.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default Can we start this over?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success Listen. Something's not right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC Friends, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC Bring it on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default We know there's a traitor among you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default Help us, and we'll help you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC Shh! He's looking at us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC I'll tell you what.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure You think you can fool me that easily?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC I don't buy it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes You must have a hearing problem, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default Hey, there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal Greetings, soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC Name's Robar Sharp.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal I gather you are a veteran of long standing?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default Tell us about Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default Tell us about Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default Tell us about Lisbath.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default What should we do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default Mercenary small talk
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC Clearly not. Look around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC Losing the captain broke her.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default What do you think of Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC Never liked him. He's hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal Very wise.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal I understand.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default How about Lisbath? You're her superior?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC Good woman. Strong, brave.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC You can trust her with a sword… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC …that's worth something in my book.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default So you fought at Sandreed too?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC That's the plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default So what do you think we should do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default So if we find a way, you're with us?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal Right… we need to make a decision here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal It's clear that something must be done.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal Let them. Could be fun to watch.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal What if he really is hiding something important?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN We confront him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN He might be a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN It's just gossip.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN Let's not risk a fight.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal We need to talk to him, find out the truth.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer It's just paranoia, or personal grudges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer If we accuse him, it might end in blood.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN We take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN We get out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN Let's talk to them all together.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN We push Sharp to mutiny.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer Let's just get them together and discuss this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction All right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction I'm not sure, but… fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction Agreed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction I don't think that's a good idea.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction We can't do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default We need to talk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC Do we?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN Not now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN You were with an expedition recently.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout Well… maybe later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal About this trip to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC That's what we do, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default The Soraks attacked after you came back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC So what - I brought them here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default Listen, colleague… you can trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC You, maybe… but the others? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default Did you bring something back?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC We always do, like the Scavengers.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default But maybe this time, you took something special.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC It's nothing of value to Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default How would you know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default Show me, colleague.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default Just trust us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default We could simply take it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default We can pay for it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default We're not blaming you, but we need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC It's just an old book… might be of historical value.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default The Council will reward you if you help us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC You won't buy me with words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default Show us, or we'll help ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade Trust us. We're all on the same side here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC We just need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC Hey, what's that? Hey!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations Hey, there!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations Deputies.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN We want you to take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout Never mind. We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC She'll refuse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal We'll back you up. She won't have a choice.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC No can do… it won't work.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC What's that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC Him? Just like that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal We order it, as deputies of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC Bullshit.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC Told ya.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC In your dreams!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC He'll get you killed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal She took that well.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal So boss, what's the plan?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal Right then, what do you say, officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC What the… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked Lieutenant!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default Can we talk?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC What now?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN You should step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout Sorry, we'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl You do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default You need to step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC Oh? And why is that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang Because you're no damn use… that's why!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN We are taking command.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN Robar should lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN Your ancestors would agree.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC You… well… chain of command, I suppose.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default Robar Sharp will command in your stead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default He's capable enough.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default Mind your words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC Maybe you're right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC I can't believe you're doing this to me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal How dare you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC Hey, what's that… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked Robar!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC You've got some explaining to do…
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default Daliat was hiding this from you.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal We believe it may have attracted the Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal That's probably why they attacked.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default He refused to let it go, despite the danger.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC I'm not surprised. 
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC Me neither.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC Wait… what… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC Robar, no!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC You… this is all your fault… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default Soldiers die. You should know that.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default Maraike will take his soul to peace.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default …and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC You people - just leave me alone!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC You can't do that! 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default He came from here! Look!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default What's this? A secret passage?
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default From Imperial times… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default That was just a scout… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default …more will be coming.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default They're coming back! Outside!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default We need to go! Take your stuff.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default Into the secret passage, before it's too late!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC I should have… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC Soraks… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC Right. Who's crazy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default We must alert the Council!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal We need to get out of here, that's what we need!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal Surviving is what matters now.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal Look at that skin! It's unbelievable… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC Oh, no… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC You know she had it coming. She failed us.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default Happy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC We didn't do this… the… Sorak did.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default Right, then. They are real.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default This is unbelievable! The Council must know!
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default And we need to leave, or we'll be next.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default Seems quiet. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default Hey, where's Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default He was here a moment ago.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default The Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC Daliat always had his own secrets. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC I think he just went his own way.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal Think they're Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal Are those Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default Who else?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default We can surprise them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default Can't we sneak around?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default From what I see, not a chance.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default What do you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default Typical Manacalon architecture… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default …the stonecutting is textbook… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default …using this orange stone from the mountain.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default That's it? Orange stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal Is that all? Stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default I'm not answering that.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal I won't dignify that question with an answer.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno I guess it's… good stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno Well, that was enlightening.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal What's this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal What is this thing?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal I think it was a Minor Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default To magically travel through the Empire.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default I don't suppose it still works?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default Some say there are still functioning Gates.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default And this plaque? Any value?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default This one didn't die yesterday.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default What's this outfit?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default Who wants to open this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default You never know, there might be a fortune in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default Can anyone read that?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default It's old Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default So that's from… the tower up there?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default Maybe we're inside the tower?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default Is that gold?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default This is history. History, all around us!
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default We're safe!
Narration/&CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default The road isn't far.
Narration/&CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?
Narration/&CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?
Narration/&CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC Of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC Sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC Yeah.
Narration/&Council01_1_NPC_Carran Oh, here you are!
Narration/&Council01_2_NPC_Carran How was the mission?
Narration/&Council01_3_Any_Practical Successful.
Narration/&Council01_4_Any_Exalted You won't believe it!
Narration/&Council01_5_Any_Cynical We almost died!
Narration/&Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar We must report to the Council immediately.
Narration/&Council01_7_Any_Greedy Not paid enough.
Narration/&Council01_8_Any_Seenitall Business as usual.
Narration/&Council01_9_Any_Violent Let's say we earned a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran Good.
Narration/&Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran Let's hope the Council does, then!
Narration/&Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran Yes here you are, safe and sound.
Narration/&Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned.
Narration/&Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran Who is?
Narration/&Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran I appreciate your professionalism.
Narration/&Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran There's no dishonor in a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_17_Any_Practical When can we hope for an audience?
Narration/&Council01_18_NPC_Carran It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky. 
Narration/&Council01_19_NPC_Carran Another party came back yesterday… 
Narration/&Council01_20_NPC_Carran …and they still have to make their report, so… 
Narration/&Council01_21_NPC_Carran …maybe they'll see you both at once.
Narration/&Council01_22_Any_Practical We have urgent news!
Narration/&Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!
Narration/&Council01_24_Any_Practical The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!
Narration/&Council01_25_Any_Practical Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_26_NPC_Carran By all the gods!
Narration/&Council01_27_NPC_Carran Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_28_NPC_Carran I'll inform my superiors.
Narration/&Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar This cannot wait!
Narration/&Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_32_NPC_Carran Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_33_NPC_Carran Is that a joke?
Narration/&Council01_34_Any_Other I'm afraid not. 
Narration/&Council01_35_Any_Other_slang We saw them… with our own eyes!
Narration/&Council01_36_NPC_Carran Well, if you want to bring that to the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_37_NPC_Carran …that's your decision.
Narration/&Council01_38_NPC_Carran If you're so eager to look like idiots… 
Narration/&Council01_39_NPC_Carran Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_40_NPC_Speaker The Legacy Council is now in session.
Narration/&Council01_41_NPC_Speaker Captain Heather Merran has the floor.
Narration/&Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness… 
Narration/&Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan …my party and I have made a very worrying discovery.
Narration/&Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan In the Badlands… 
Narration/&Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan …near the place we call Black Hill… 
Narration/&Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan …we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers.
Narration/&Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan They attacked us right away… 
Narration/&Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan …but we were able to fight them off.
Narration/&Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan They were trying to get away with this.
Narration/&Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir What is it?
Narration/&Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear.
Narration/&Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan We have determined that it has magical properties… 
Narration/&Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan …and we believe the Council should examine it.
Narration/&Council01_54_NPC_Danantar So we will, captain, but really… 
Narration/&Council01_55_NPC_Danantar …is that all? 
Narration/&Council01_56_NPC_Danantar You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?
Narration/&Council01_57_NPC_Danantar Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule… 
Narration/&Council01_58_NPC_Princess Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic.
Narration/&Council01_59_NPC_Danantar Hear, hear!
Narration/&Council01_60_NPC_Danantar Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business… 
Narration/&Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_62_NPC_Danantar … 
Narration/&Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech Is this a joke?
Narration/&Council01_65_NPC_Einar The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!
Narration/&Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech Oh, you know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_67_NPC_Princess What do you mean, my lord?
Narration/&Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir At least twenty, I'd say.
Narration/&Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze More. Twenty-three.
Narration/&Council01_71_NPC_Danantar More each year. It's becoming a fad.
Narration/&Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default We did, too!
Narration/&Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted It's true! They're real!
Narration/&Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!
Narration/&Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical She's telling the truth!
Narration/&Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech What?
Narration/&Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech And who might you be?
Narration/&Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently.
Narration/&Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems.
Narration/&Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean They assure me that they saw Soraks as well.
Narration/&Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze Wait!
Narration/&Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze Do you realize how serious this is?
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN We saw them.
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN They attacked Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1 We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2 The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3 They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!
Narration/&Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1 We have never had two sightings reported at the same time.
Narration/&Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1 Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?
Narration/&Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2 Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?
Narration/&Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2 Yes, sir!
Narration/&Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2 Reptilians… fast, strong… 
Narration/&Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative …they can climb on walls just like spiders!
Narration/&Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default …they're tough, too!
Narration/&Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3 Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches? 
Narration/&Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3 What do you mean by heavy losses?
Narration/&Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative The Soraks took over captain Henrik… 
Narration/&Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative …and only two of them are still alive.
Narration/&Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative They can testify, too.
Narration/&Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir Do you have any… material proof of their existence?
Narration/&Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative I beg your pardon?
Narration/&Council01_101_NPC_Morgan Like what?
Narration/&Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech Well… A dead body, for example!
Narration/&Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech Or even just a head?
Narration/&Council01_104_NPC_Einar If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative Probably not.
Narration/&Council01_106_NPC_Morgan They took their dead with them when they retreated.
Narration/&Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative The bodies of their victims, too.
Narration/&Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech Hm! How very convenient!
Narration/&Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech So you can offer us no proof of this… 
Narration/&Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech …adventurer's fable.
Narration/&Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?
Narration/&Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech What proof? How? 
Narration/&Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say.
Narration/&Council01_114_NPC_Danantar That's not our problem. Let them find a way.
Narration/&Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind These are new recruits, correct?
Narration/&Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind Then let this be their new mission:
Narration/&Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see.
Narration/&Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?
Narration/&Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem.
Narration/&Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech If there is nothing else?
Narration/&Council01_121_NPC_Speaker Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!
Narration/&Council01_122_NPC_Speaker Does any member object?
Narration/&Council01_123_NPC_Speaker No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!
Narration/&Council01_124_NPC_Carran That actually went better than I expected.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN Who's the grumpy dwarf?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN We had to stand by Merran.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN The Princess is bland.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN They are seat-warmers.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces.
Narration/&Council01_129_NPC_Carran Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Council01_130_NPC_Carran She's… Well, yes. Quite.
Narration/&Council01_131_NPC_Carran I'm sure she will appreciate your support.
Narration/&Council01_132_NPC_Carran Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN Someone older.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN Someone… a little more presentable?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN Someone more dignified.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait… 
Narration/&Council01_134_NPC_Carran Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_135_NPC_Carran …but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality.
Narration/&Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?
Narration/&Council01_137_NPC_Carran Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities.
Narration/&Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility Someone more… regal?
Narration/&Council01_139_NPC_Carran No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!
Narration/&Council01_140_Player_Nobility You know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_141_NPC_Carran No, actually… I don't.
Narration/&Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!
Narration/&Council01_143_NPC_Carran And your employers, let's not forget.
Narration/&Council01_144_NPC_Carran I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body.
Narration/&Council01_145_NPC_Carran Anyway… 
Narration/&Council01_146_NPC_Carran …some people might want to talk to you after this.
Narration/&Council01_147_NPC_Carran Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral.
Narration/&Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default But?
Narration/&Council01_149_NPC_Carran But you have the right to have friends.
Narration/&Council01_150_NPC_Carran So feel free to talk to whoever you like.
Narration/&Council01_151_NPC_Carran As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole.
Narration/&Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal You may rely on our honor.
Narration/&Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal Of course.
Narration/&Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang All right, then.
Narration/&Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01 Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!
Narration/&Council01_156_AnyFriendly You're welcome, Captain. 
Narration/&Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02 So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame.
Narration/&Council01_158_Curious You knew him?
Narration/&Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03 Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now...
Narration/&Council01_160_Friendly The Scavengers could lead the way.
Narration/&Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04 Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure.
Narration/&Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05 Stay in the light, friends!
Narration/&Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly You, too!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC Well, if it isn't our brave saviors.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default Good day, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal Salutations, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default The Snow Alliance?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC I will never step foot in the Badlands again.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default I understand your reluctance.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack? 
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC You mean Daliat?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC Greetings, deputies.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal Are you ready to come clean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC Of course it's my name. What are you implying?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC What do you mean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC I won't take you there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC But I can show you the location on a map.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC Of course, nothing is free.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default Indeed. Thank you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC I'm glad we could come to some agreement.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default As are we.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC It's just business, after all.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default We did indeed.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC To what do I owe the honor?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC Looking for Soraks, are we?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default Possibly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC You people are crazy.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default Appreciate the help, Robar.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC Though I may have just helped you into an early grave.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default This time we'll take them by surprise.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC Right. Good luck with that.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default Farewell, Robar!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal What is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal What's going on here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang What the hell did we just stumble into?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default These aren't Soraks. They seem human.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default What exactly are they doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal This ruin dates back to Imperial times.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default Who are these people? Scavengers?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default Well, there is one way to find out.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default Perhaps we should sneak a little closer.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers01 Alert!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal All right - no talking, then… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal Looks like there won't be any parley… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default So what do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal Humans.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang They look like people to me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default What's that symbol there?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default The tattoo?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default Looks like an A.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default They all have it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal Guess they're all part of the same club.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default "A" could stand for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default Are you kidding me?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default That's not good.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default At least we know we're in the right place.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default Should we see what they're doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default Please don't kill me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default What are you doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default I'm just a worker.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default Are you tattooed with an A?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default I… you don't understand…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default Are you one of them?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default One of what? I'm just trying to survive. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default I had no choice.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill You must die.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive Get out of here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo Tell us about the tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps Are the Soraks around?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive Run! Run for your life! 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo What does the tattoo signify?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps Are the Soraks close by?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default It's… I can't…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default He's dead. How is that possible? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default How is any of this possible?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default He was doomed from the start.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default They're here. They're close…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default If they know that I…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC Another statue… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal These guys really loved themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal Now, this is an Emperor.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal …he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal Good job managing the trouble, mister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal He made history, but not the way he would have wanted.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default This place is astounding.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default What kind of runes are those?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default It is said they had eight schools of magic.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default Each is represented here. All as equals.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default That was… unexpected.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default This place is topsy-turvy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default Magic from a time long forgotten. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default Remind me not to take a dump in that hole.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default Do you really have to make jokes?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default Something funny suddenly comes to mind…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default Can you keep it to yourself?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default We did it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.  
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default They didn't die easily.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default Worthy foes, indeed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal Thankfully, we prevailed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang Got every one of those ugly bastards.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal They bleed just like we do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default Now just need one of their frickin' heads.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default Would you look at this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default A crown of some kind?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default They seemed to keep their distance from it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default Maybe it's cursed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default Look what I found.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default Let me take a look.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default What language is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default Looks like ancient Tirmarian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang Is this the language of those damned lizards? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal That has to be a Sorak name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default Take it then. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default Perhaps we should rest before we head back.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default I say we go.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default The mission is done after all.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default All right, then - I'll do it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default After you, friends.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE Take the Crown
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default Interesting.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default Do you think it has magical properties?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default And I should care because?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal Who knows what it might contain.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default But it looks like it's locked.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default First things first. We have a mission to complete.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default Fancy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default Beautiful craftsmanship.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default She looks like an empress.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default Could this have been her home?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default Possibly.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default You are an idiot.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default You see that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default Is that a Sorak?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default It's a dragon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default It's no bigger than a man.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang No shit?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal If you say so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal I don't think so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default Is this one of those rocks that…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default Nope. This place is insane.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default In the Badlands…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default I know… expect the unexpected. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default Well, that didn't do a damn thing. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default Did you really think that would open the door?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default I need to break some frickin' heads!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default We need to be smarter about this. Think it through.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default Your faces are not the last faces I want to see.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default Stay hidden. They're here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default What else could they be?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal You ready to do this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal This is it, friends. Stay strong.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default Get in position…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default …hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default Ready.
Narration/&CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal You look a little pale. Is something wrong?
Narration/&CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced.
Narration/&CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default I don't feel too good. 
Narration/&CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default I knew that old Crown was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default You don't know that.
Narration/&CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default Just get rid of it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal Perhaps we should leave it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default No, we need it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default Need it? For what?
Narration/&CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside.
Narration/&CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default Are you okay?
Narration/&CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default I just need to rest for a bit.
Narration/&CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either.
Narration/&CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default I'm exhausted as well.
Narration/&CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default Maybe the curse has affected us all.
Narration/&CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default Stop it. Don't be ridiculous.
Narration/&CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp.
Narration/&CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal I propose we set up camp and get some rest.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default We did it! We brought back proof!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default How do you feel?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default Better.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default Maybe that sickness was nothing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal It might have been a simple fever, after all.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default What about the Crown?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default You know the Council will probably take it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default No!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default It's our loot! Ours!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default We have to declare anything of historical value… 
Narration/&BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default …and they have the right to buy it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default And if it's priceless?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default Come on! They can do whatever they want.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default Sure.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default I guess we'll see.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal We must wait and see, and hope for the best.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default Who fought the Soraks - us or them?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_1_1_Partner_Default Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC Ah - deputies! 
Narration/&Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC I see you found some nice shiny loot.
Narration/&Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?
Narration/&Council02_1_4_Partner_Default One head, slightly damaged.
Narration/&Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!
Narration/&Council02_1_6_Partner_Default At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive.
Narration/&Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC I can only imagine.
Narration/&Council02_1_8_Partner_Default When's the next Council meeting?
Narration/&Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC When? Now, of course!
Narration/&Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace.
Narration/&Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC They're waiting for you.
Narration/&Council02_1_12_Partner_Default They are?
Narration/&Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC Well, more for… this. But come on!
Narration/&Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC Now, there's a trophy.
Narration/&Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC And by the way, who's crazy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_16_Default_Default All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me.
Narration/&Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default Maybe it's a curse.
Narration/&Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC The curse of being surrounded by idiots… 
Narration/&Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to.
Narration/&Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_22_Default_Default Who's this guy again?
Narration/&Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say.
Narration/&Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC But now - well, you can see for yourself.
Narration/&Council02_1_25_Curious_Default Who's this old lady?
Narration/&Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC Just ignore him.
Narration/&Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC Let's go.
Narration/&Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe.
Narration/&Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC Well, then - it seems we have a problem.
Narration/&Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!
Narration/&Council02_2_5_Partner_Default There's something else.
Narration/&Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC What?
Narration/&Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC A Crown?
Narration/&Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC Interesting. A very nice find.
Narration/&Council02_2_9_Partner_Default We don't want to sell it.
Narration/&Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC Why not? You know we pay well.
Narration/&Council02_2_11_Partner_Default We want to keep it.
Narration/&Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC I'd like to take a look at it, though.
Narration/&Council02_2_13_Partner_Default … 
Narration/&Council02_2_14_Authority_Default Come on, let them take a look.
Narration/&Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC Any ideas?
Narration/&Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style… 
Narration/&Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic… 
Narration/&Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC I have a spell I'd like to cast on this.
Narration/&Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!
Narration/&Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC What?
Narration/&Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default What happened?
Narration/&Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default You passed out.
Narration/&Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default Where are we?
Narration/&Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default The Temple of Einar.
Narration/&Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here.
Narration/&Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default We certainly made an impression on the Council.
Narration/&Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default They believe you're attuned to the Crown… 
Narration/&Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default …that you can't be separated from it.
Narration/&Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default What? So it is cursed?
Narration/&Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped.
Narration/&Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default They cast spells on the crown, on you… 
Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there.
Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready.
Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC It's an honor, deputies.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default Who are you?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC I'm just a junior aide in the Council…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC …but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC …just see me at the Tower, downtown.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default Why the sudden interest in us?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC You proved yourselves in the Badlands…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC …and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default All right - we'll think about it.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC Greetings, Sorak slayers!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default Hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC …how about that for neutrality?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. 
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default Like the Scavengers?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC But we can offer more than gold.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default Good to know. Thanks for the invitation.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority We're in kind of a hurry.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I know. I won't delay you long.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default You're smarter than you look.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Also quite indifferent to mockery.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default Really? Not at the embassy?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default What? How did he… ?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default Maybe he just agrees about the taste.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC Would you have a moment, deputies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default All right, but make it quick.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC I'll do my best.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default The same magic school where the Princess studies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC Exactly. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default Fine.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default He talked a lot, for sure.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC He's a man of great authority.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC You can find me at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default More than the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC They would disagree - but yes.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC …that would be troubling to many on the Council.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC Of course. Neutrality is the rule.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC Good day to you, deputies.
Narration/&Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC Ah - our crownbearer is up again!
Narration/&Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!
Narration/&Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC Lord Danantar has the floor.
Narration/&Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown.
Narration/&Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen.
Narration/&Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC I strongly recommend against forcing a separation.
Narration/&Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC Chancellor Gormsdottir?
Narration/&Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment.
Narration/&Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently.
Narration/&Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC I have reason to believe that it might be… 
Narration/&Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!
Narration/&Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC What have you done?
Narration/&Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!
Narration/&Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC Wait!
Narration/&Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC Are you going to faint again?
Narration/&Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN I just had a… vision, I guess it was.
Narration/&Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN I must… find the other gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer I just had a vision.
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer The Crown wants the other gems back.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC A vision? In an instant?
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default Then… who were you?
Narration/&Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default A paladin… powerful… 
Narration/&Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default …from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC That is… unsettling.
Narration/&Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now.
Narration/&Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC I concur.
Narration/&Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC What about this artifact? The other gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC What?
Narration/&Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default I think I can find them. I can… feel them.
Narration/&Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC You said it wasn't sentient.
Narration/&Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible.
Narration/&Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest.
Narration/&Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed.
Narration/&Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?
Narration/&Council02_5_22_All_NPC Aye!
Narration/&Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC Your Royal Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur… 
Narration/&Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC To which proposition, Your Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC So resolved! Let it be recorded!
Narration/&Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess.
Narration/&Council02_5_29_Char1_Default What was that?
Narration/&Council02_5_30_Char1_Default You had a vision?
Narration/&Council02_5_31_Char2_Default What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission.
Narration/&Council02_5_33_Char3_Default All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?
Narration/&Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default I think… the Crown knows.
Narration/&Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!
Narration/&Merton_01_2_Any_Default It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC Damn right!
Narration/&Merton_01_4_Any_Default First Scavenger? Where does that come from?
Narration/&Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC Long story, kid.
Narration/&Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first.
Narration/&Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing.
Narration/&Merton_01_8_Any_Default What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?
Narration/&Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them.
Narration/&Merton_01_10_Any_Default You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?
Narration/&Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all.
Narration/&Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands.
Narration/&Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure.
Narration/&Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC It's because I got them figured out.
Narration/&Merton_01_15_Any_Default Figured out how?
Narration/&Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC This Legacy Council is full of it.
Narration/&Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other.
Narration/&Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift.
Narration/&Merton_01_19_Any_Default Uh - okay…
Narration/&Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?
Narration/&Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!
Narration/&Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC Lord Keenmind has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum… 
Narration/&Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC …have gathered crucial information about this Crown.
Narration/&Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions… 
Narration/&Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC …ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools.
Narration/&Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC In time of need, each the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers… 
Narration/&Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC …that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power.
Narration/&Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council03_13_All_NPC overlapping murmurs
Narration/&Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC Indeed.
Narration/&Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC Now… there is some debate about… 
Narration/&Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC …whether the Crown, with all its gems… 
Narration/&Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC …could possibly open another Rift…
Narration/&Council03_18_All_NPC overlapping protestations
Narration/&Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC …or even reopen the previous one.
Narration/&Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!
Narration/&Council03_21_Danantar_NPC Solasta paid a high enough price for that!
Narration/&Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC Have you been to the Badlands recently?
Narration/&Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC Order!
Narration/&Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC Marshal Sunblaze has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…
Narration/&Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC …we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC Impossible!
Narration/&Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence.
Narration/&Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift? 
Narration/&Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!
Narration/&Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC No one knows for sure what the Crown can do.
Narration/&Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC It's a theory.
Narration/&Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells… 
Narration/&Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC …that is one of its mysterious powers.
Narration/&Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC Then why would the Soraks think they know better?
Narration/&Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC Because they're Soraks!
Narration/&Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!
Narration/&Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive.
Narration/&Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC Fables and conjectures!
Narration/&Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC Perhaps.
Narration/&Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC But can we take the risk?
Narration/&Council03_43_Danantar_NPC The Crown must be secured!
Narration/&Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules.
Narration/&Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC The quest for the gems should be completed.
Narration/&Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers.
Narration/&Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense.
Narration/&Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?
Narration/&Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC This is nonsense!
Narration/&Council03_50_Princess_NPC Maybe the deputies would like to speak.
Narration/&Council03_51_Princess_NPC After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN We'll continue the quest.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN Give us weapons.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN You should trust us more.
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN The Crown is ours.
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems.
Narration/&Council03_53_Authority_Formal With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves.
Narration/&Council03_54_Authority_Slang We got this. Really, it's under control.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?
Narration/&Council03_56_Greed_Formal May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?
Narration/&Council03_57_Greed_Slang We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance.
Narration/&Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance.
Narration/&Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!
Narration/&Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown.
Narration/&Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours.
Narration/&Council03_64_Danantar_NPC Confidence? I like that.
Narration/&Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC Preposterous!
Narration/&Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?
Narration/&Council03_67_Authority_Default Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go.
Narration/&Council03_68_Einarboss_Default The Soraks will come after you - you know that?
Narration/&Council03_69_Einarboss_Default But you have our complete support in this struggle.
Narration/&Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal Our thanks, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal Thanks.
Narration/&Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!
Narration/&Council03_74_Danantar_NPC Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_75_Greed_Default We're just trying to increase our chance of success.
Narration/&Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC Of course you are.
Narration/&Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival.
Narration/&Council03_78_Danantar_NPC Trust is a hot topic, these days.
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already.
Narration/&Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC Yet, we should support you in your efforts.
Narration/&Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC And we will.
Narration/&Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?
Narration/&Council03_74_Selfishness_Default The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else.
Narration/&Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?
Narration/&Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership.
Narration/&Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC If that is all, may we conclude?
Narration/&Council03_78_Princess_NPC I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate.
Narration/&Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC Of course, Your Highness. We are listening.
Narration/&Council03_80_Princess_NPC I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn.
Narration/&Council03_81_Princess_NPC We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace. 
Narration/&Council03_82_Princess_NPC They would be safer there, don't you think?
Narration/&Council03_83_Princess_NPC That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest.
Narration/&Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC Ahem - Your Highness?
Narration/&Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval.
Narration/&Council03_86_Princess_NPC Oh! Right…
Narration/&Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?
Narration/&Council03_88_Princess_NPC Of course. I beg the Council's pardon.
Narration/&Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC Not at all, Your Highness.
Narration/&Council03_90_Danantar_NPC Then I think that is all?
Narration/&Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC A word, please, deputies?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default Sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal Of course.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang What's up?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default What's that?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal I'm not sure what that is.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default Sounds nice.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal It's an honor!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC You don't say?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default Where is this residence?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC Oh, another thing…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default Yes?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default What's this?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default Teleport?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default We can't do that, I'm pretty sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC Well, word is that in the Badlands…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC …you may come across functioning Major Gates.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC …and you'll be able to return there the same way.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default That's fantastic!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC Don't get too excited.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC So far, no one's found any.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default Oh. Right. Thanks anyway.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC Stay in the light, senior deputies.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default You too, Captain.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default Fire to your blade!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC I am Chaplain Dalon Lark.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar That is good to know, Chaplain!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default Hello!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default What do you do here?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC We provide various services for those who need them.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default And can pay for them?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC Those who seek his healing are rarely poor.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default We do require your services.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default Thank you - we need to go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC Stay in the light, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine We should go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine We need your services.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Anything new for the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang Check this out!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default Possibly.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC That's nice of you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Stay in the light!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer Let's talk business!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC Deputies.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC Do you have anything for the Circle?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default Take a look.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal We might.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC Not really. Just stopped by to say hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default It's an honor. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC Stay in the light, deputies!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Exitline Just saying hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Offer What about this?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC You have some treasure in your backpacks?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang Feast your eyes on this!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default See what you think of this.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC Just passing by to say hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC Ah, well. It was good to see you.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC See you next time, friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine Just passing by.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer What about this?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC Deputies! How are you today?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang How 'bout that?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default Indeed.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC Such nice manners! All too rare, these days.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC Clear skies to you!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Exitline Just missed you.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Offer How about that?
Narration/&Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council4_3_Danantar_NPC Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?
Narration/&Council4_4_Authority_Normal We're stuck, my lord.
Narration/&Council4_5_Authority_Formal My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal.
Narration/&Council4_6_Authority_Slang It's not good news, my Lord.
Narration/&Council4_7_Faisech_NPC Meaning what, exactly?
Narration/&Council4_8_Any_Default We have six gems, but we can't seem to find the others.
Narration/&Council4_9_Gormsdottir_NPC Two gems missing?
Narration/&Council4_10_Faisech_NPC Perhaps they've been destroyed.
Narration/&Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC We tested the first one - it can't be done!
Narration/&Council4_12_Danantar_NPC They must be magically concealed.
Narration/&Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC So the Crown must remain incomplete?
Narration/&Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_16_Faisech_NPC If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?
Narration/&Council4_17_Faisech_NPC It will keep attracting the Soraks.
Narration/&Council4_18_Danantar_NPC The attunement, remember?
Narration/&Council4_19_Faisech_NPC I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement...
Narration/&Council4_20_Faisech_NPC ...I believe the Crown should be secured...
Narration/&Council4_21_Faisech_NPC ...and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!
Narration/&Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!
Narration/&Council4_23_Faisech_NPC Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!
Narration/&Council4_24_Faisech_NPC You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!
Narration/&Council4_25_Authority_Normal We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk.
Narration/&Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_27_Danantar_NPC If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation.
Narration/&Council4_28_Faisech_NPC More time? How much time?
Narration/&Council4_29_Danantar_NPC Maybe just...give it a night.
Narration/&Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC I could use the day to consult with my people.
Narration/&Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC So could I.
Narration/&Council4_32_Danantar_NPC Fine, then! Anyone against?
Narration/&Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC Thank you, Lord Danantar.
Narration/&Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC The Legacy Council is now ajdourned!
Narration/&Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!
Narration/&Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs...doesn't matter if I die!
Narration/&Council4_38_Authority_Normal This is wrong.
Narration/&Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal We could run.
Narration/&Council4_40_Authority_Normal What's the point? We know what's at stake.
Narration/&Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal They're right about one thing.
Narration/&Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_43_Authority_Normal We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked.
Narration/&Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!
Narration/&Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Excuse me, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council4_46_Highclass_Formal Master Surespell.
Narration/&Council4_47_Any_Normal Clear skies, Heddlon.
Narration/&Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight.
Narration/&Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal What? Why?
Narration/&Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I'm not at liberty to say...just trust me.
Narration/&Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there.
Narration/&Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal What kind of advice is that?
Narration/&Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal You must realize your suggestion is...unusual. Suspicious, even.
Narration/&Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?
Narration/&Council4_55_Nosy_Normal Are you really working for the Arcaneum? 
Narration/&Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Why else would I be here?
Narration/&Council4_57_Mean_Normal This elf is...
Narration/&Council4_58_Lawful_Normal What do you think?
Narration/&Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal It sounds like a warning.
Narration/&Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal Or a threat!
Narration/&Council4_61_Lawful_Normal Can we trust him?
Narration/&Council4_62_Carver_Normal Trust the New Empire?
Narration/&Council4_63_Greed_Normal I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight.
Narration/&Council4_64_Cynical_Normal I miss Karel's beer.
Narration/&Council4_65_Any4_Normal And Merton's sweet talk.
Narration/&Council4_66_Cynical_Normal I'd prefer the residence.
Narration/&Council4_67_Cynical_Normal I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight.
Narration/&Council4_68_Authority_Normal Maybe in your dreams.
Narration/&NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default Soraks - here?
Narration/&NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang Soraks! Right here in our damn room!
Narration/&NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!
Narration/&NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default We were warned.
Narration/&NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default Surespell? How did he know?
Narration/&NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default Why would he know what the Soraks would do?
Narration/&NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do.
Narration/&NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang He tried to save our hides, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal His warning might have saved us all, mind you.
Narration/&NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal He just wants us to think he's a friend.
Narration/&NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust.
Narration/&NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default Too far-fetched.
Narration/&NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default So what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang What's the plan, then?
Narration/&NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal Be that as it may, what shall we do now?
Narration/&NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful.
Narration/&NightAttack2_6_Any_Default How did you know?
Narration/&NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Call it a hunch. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?
Narration/&NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal Oh, really?
Narration/&NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal You can't expect us to believe that?
Narration/&NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Oh, I have friends who...gather information.
Narration/&NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share.
Narration/&NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal It felt real enough to us, too.
Narration/&NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain.
Narration/&NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default You know more than you're telling.
Narration/&NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters.
Narration/&NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?
Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?
Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul.
Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal Seriously? Everyone knows that!
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC But clearly you're here for business, not small talk.
Narration/&NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Not at all, since you followed my...advice.
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Default How do you know that?
Narration/&NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC You're here, alive and unwounded.
Narration/&NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I heard there was some disturbance at the residence.
Narration/&NightAttack4_7_Any_Default Is that so?
Narration/&NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC Senior deputies!
Narration/&NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default Captain! What's the news?
Narration/&NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC You didn't hear?
Narration/&NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!
Narration/&NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default What? When?
Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC During the night. It's lucky you weren't there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two.
Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected.
Narration/&NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default Who, then?
Narration/&NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC I can't say for sure but...
Narration/&NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC Some are saying...Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal That's a worrying prospect, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!
Narration/&NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal We were supposed to be safe there, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place.
Narration/&NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default Good to know.
Narration/&NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal Thanks for the heads-up, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal Thank you for keeping us informed, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC You are most welcome.
Narration/&NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC Good day to you, senior deputies.
Narration/&NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal So he told the truth, that Heddlon.
Narration/&NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal It appears, Heddlon Surespell was right.
Narration/&NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default He knew, but how?
Narration/&NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal He's a spy, or something similar.
Narration/&NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence.
Narration/&NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face.
Narration/&NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default He looks normal to me.
Narration/&NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default That's what spies do. 
Narration/&NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default So, what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang So - now what?
Narration/&NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal We must decide on our next move.
Narration/&NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor.
Narration/&Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC Thank you, Protector.
Narration/&Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC Honourable Council members, we've seen Soraks in the palace - and their god Sorr-Tarr has other followers, too. 
Narration/&Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC It's clear the Crown is not safe. The Antiquarians' Guild moves that the Crown be taken to a place of safety.
Narration/&Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC While the deputies search for the remaining gems…
Narration/&Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC ..the Council will study the Crown and decide how it may best be used.
Narration/&Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC The Guild proposes that the Council vote on this matter immediately.
Narration/&Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default You can't!
Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!
Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?
Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC Order!
Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them.
Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply...
Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC ...for the security of all.
Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default Security? You talk of security?
Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!
Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC What?
Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&Council5_21_Danantar_NPC In the palace?
Narration/&Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC Order!
Narration/&Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC Immediate action is needed!
Narration/&Council5_24_Danantar_NPC Well, find the damned Soraks, then!
Narration/&Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC Please, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_26_Danantar_NPC Where are your paladins?
Narration/&Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC Where are your wizards and their divination spells?
Narration/&Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC Stop it!
Narration/&Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC None of this is helping!
Narration/&Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral, here!
Narration/&Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC Someone must introduce a formal request.
Narration/&Council5_32_Danantar_NPC Right. Apologies.
Narration/&Council5_33_Danantar_NPC You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please.
Narration/&Council5_34_Danantar_NPC Those for securing the Crown, say aye.
Narration/&Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default Aye.
Narration/&Council5_36_Faisech_NPC Aye.
Narration/&Council5_37_Danantar_NPC Aye.
Narration/&Council5_38_Keenmind_Default ...nay.
Narration/&Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC Nay.
Narration/&Council5_40_Danantar_NPC Well, we have a majority.
Narration/&Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC Well help you with the...attunement issue.
Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?
Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC Well, the most secure location would be...
Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC ...the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth.
Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!
Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!
Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC We have secure locations, too!
Narration/&Council5_49_Danantar_NPC How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_50_Faisech_NPC More than actual wizards in your school!
Narration/&Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC Order!
Narration/&Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken.
Narration/&Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN This is a mistake.
Narration/&Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN You're all stupid!
Narration/&Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN We must obey the council...
Narration/&Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN Someone here is a traitor!
Narration/&Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC You are sworn deputies. You must comply.
Narration/&Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!
Narration/&Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders.
Narration/&Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default We serve the Council.
Narration/&Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC And you shall be commended, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!
Narration/&Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC This is a grave accusation, senior deputy.
Narration/&Council5_66_Authority_Default How could they?
Narration/&Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default It can't end like this!
Narration/&Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default I can hear it calling!
Narration/&Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC Senior deputies, please, a word?
Narration/&Council5_70_Authority_Default Summer? What do you want? 
Narration/&Council5_71_Authority_Default Your chancellor led the charge against us in there.
Narration/&Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you.
Narration/&Council5_73_Selfpres_Default I doubt it.
Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC It's about the secret cult of Arivad.
Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default What?
Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still...
Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default Speak up.
Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC One of my people saw a man with a tattoo...
Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default The letter A?
Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC Yes. He followed the man all day, and to gathering that night...
Narration/&Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC ...in a remote village to the South.
Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default What village?
Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC It's called Earcorn. Very small...
Narration/&Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC ...but you'll find it easily on any local map.
Narration/&Council5_85_Friendly_Default Thank you, Halman.
Narration/&Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists.
Narration/&Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC And the Council...well, you know.
Narration/&Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default Yes, we do.
Narration/&Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC I'm so sorry.
Narration/&Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default Why? You didn't betray us.
Narration/&Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC I understand how they see things, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal Something's wrong with the Council.
Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang The Council's rotten.
Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…
Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC …but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies.
Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you.
Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?
Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans.
Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience.
Narration/&Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now. 
Narration/&Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC It didn't change anything, anyway.
Narration/&Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?
Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default Better than I expected.
Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default …the voice is still calling.
Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?
Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?
Narration/&Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC You have my word.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC Hey, you!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default Not drowning in your beer, today, Arwin?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC No, wait!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC They took the Crown from you?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default How do you know that?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC How? You really think I'm just a drunk?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC The whole Principality knows you have that Crown.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC I mean had.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal Yeah.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal Indeed.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC Something's not right.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal You think we need you to tell us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC I mean something's up - something big.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal What, exactly?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC They're here.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default Who? The Soraks?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC Not them. Their pawns.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default You're drunk.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC What's wrong with you? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC Haven't you seen enough?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC Didn't you see what they can do? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC To people?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys...
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC ...but you've seen their ways.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC At Coparran, and plenty other places, I'm sure.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC The way they get into people's heads.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC I've felt a change - slow, subtle...
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC ...until now. It's getting stronger!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC I can't let them win.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default So what? You're ready to become a hero again?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC I can still fight.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default Are you offering to join us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC You brought back my sword.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC You helped me get closure for my lost child.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC Yes, I'd like to join you.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN Fine.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN No.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default Fine, come with us.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default You're useless!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton And you're stupid!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton Ha ha! Now you're talking!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default This is it? Earcorn!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal Not exactly how  I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal Let's look around for anything suspicious.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal Let us examine the area in search of clues.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default No tavern? That's suspicious, for a start.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC That was my line!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default I have something!
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default Soraks?
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default This is it! Be ready for anything.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default That didn't feel like we surprised them.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default Because we didn't.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default This was a trap.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default Halman Summer?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default He said the intelligence wasn't certain.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default He's a traitor!
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default A Sorak in disguise?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default Anyone checked him for a tattoo?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default There's only one way to know for sure.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default Let's go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal What is all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default Is that the army? In the city?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default Let's find Summer!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default I'd prefer to find Carran first.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default Check on who?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default I thought he had no friends left.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default His brewer, maybe?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC Not since the conscription.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default Conscription? Is that what's happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC I know, it's been in the air, but now...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC ...rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default Gallivan? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default Robar? You've been drafted?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC Is war really better?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default Can't disagree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC If you say so.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC Be safe, Robar.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default To the bitter end, brother.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default To the bitter end.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default You too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC Beryl? What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default What mess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC War. Or the threat of war.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default We didn't do anything!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default How about maintaining peace?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC I did my part. Didn't work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default When are you leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC Farewell, Beryl.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default Good luck, my lady.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default Daliat! What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC Well, I'd rather not say.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default Always secretive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default Do we still need to play this game?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Oh, hello.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default Are you two related?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC He's my superior.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Two ranks above.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default Right.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC So, you two are spies?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default Such a crude word.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC Nicer than 'spies.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default So, what's in there?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Nothing and no one, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I was looking for your...acquaintance, Halman Summer.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default Oh, him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default We were looking for him, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I'm afraid he's gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default Isn't everybody leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC The Antiquarians are still packing up, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default He sent after a lead...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default ...or rather, into a trap.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC I'm not surprised.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC We had eyes on him, but...we lost him.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default Is he that good?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Or he had help. Magical.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC Soraks?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC Who knows?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC What triggered all this ?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC You should really get to the Council.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC They'll tell you everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC In Maraike's name! You're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default What is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default Poisoned? How many died?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC After Dean Faisech accused the Council of...favoritism toward the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC ...for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default At the temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC I know that, of course.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC You think I don't know that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default And it failed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC We're not at war yet.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default But Gallivan's massing troops at the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC Bad news really does travel fast.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to...intervene.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default Her? How?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC Not as member of the Council. As head of state.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC But tell me, where were you now that your quest is...well...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default Chasing the Soraks and their pawns.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default Unsuccessfully.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default Halman Summer might have been one of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC What? The man was...I mean, I dined at his mansion recently...he...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default Where?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC Where what?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC No - his family has a mansion in town.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default We need to go there.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC I might need you when you're done with this errand.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal Is that it?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal Is this the place?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal Not bad for a secret home.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang He's no dummy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal Hiding in plain sight - classic.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default We should obtain a warrant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default We're past that, don't you think?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal This place is...insane.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal Truly, a den of madness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default Holy Maraike...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default Einar protect us all...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they. . ?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default Dissimulation is their creed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default This ends now. Let's kill them all!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default Maybe they have the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's cask.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal They're all from town!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal Corrupted by the Soraks!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal For years, maybe. They were preparing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal There's a ton of paperwork here.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal A lot's been burned, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal No sign of the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal Look at this - a map of the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal What are these places?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal Everywhere we've been...and some other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal The gems...all eight of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal Probably the location of the Rift.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal It's in the Aer-Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal No idea.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal Not a dwarf rune.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal I have a list of names.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal There's a whole book of names here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal We must take this to the authorities!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal War is coming whatever we do.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal Lord Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC This isn't a good time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC Surely you exaggerate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC What? Where did you find this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC I can't believe it...all this time...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal There's more!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal Everything suggests that the Soraks have the two missing gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC Maraike's mercy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC We must convene the Council, but... this really isn't the best time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal The Gallivan situation, I suppose?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang Gallivan, eh? How it is going?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default What?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC The envoy from Gallivan was...adamant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC The Princess took command of the situation...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC ...and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default So why the troops at the border?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC Let's call it...an incentive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default Everything should be fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC To defend the city. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default So much for confidence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default So you're resurrecting Faisech?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC I know what you're going to say. So don't.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default And someone must pray for his soul... Imagine that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default Wait a minute!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default Where is this happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC In the temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC Wait, you don't...they died!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default You think they'd stop at that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC ...close to the Crown of the Magister?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC No! No, no, no!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC What are we waiting for?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default Marshal!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC Greetings, friends!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default Where are the delegates?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC In the dispensary.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default Are you all right?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC I just cast a resurrection spell...forgive me - it is rather draining.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC Wait!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal Feeling good, dead people?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal Alright, everyone, we know who you are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC Attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC By Einar...Sorak agents, in the temple!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default Where's the Crown?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC Take this key. I...can't run.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC Follow the light!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default Let's go!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default There!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default It's gone!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default Here! A secret passage?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default In the middle of the Temple?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default How did they miss that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default Doesn't matter now!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default No time for a history lesson!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default They went this way!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default The city's Imperial Gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default They're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default They're trying to get away with the Crown!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default Protector!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC We failed! They got away with it!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default No!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC There's too many of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC Come on! Fight!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default Look!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default The Princess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC One day, Arwin Merton...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC Don't look at me like that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default Your royal highness...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC ...thank you is what you're looking for.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default Thank you.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default They took the Crown.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC Is this...evil god coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default I suppose that's their plan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default Can we follow them? 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default There's no way to know where they're gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default There are so many gates.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default No one knows exactly where the Rift was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC In the Aer-Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default So we're doomed?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC We're under attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default Your royal highness...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default Do you have any ideas?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC This is the Sunset Peak, south of Aer-Elai. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC I recognize this tower...or what's left of it.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC There is a gate not too far away.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC But who knows how the place looks like now?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default They don't stand a chance against you!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default What? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC There's no time to explain - you have to trust me.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC Only you can save Solasta now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default Us? What about all your...heroes, and all?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default Oh...they planned this as well, didn't they?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC Protector Kean is not what she used to be.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default Merton? You coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC Kaisenax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default The Magister? You knew him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC You're too curious for your own good.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default So, Merton's staying.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default Fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC And my blessing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default My arm is yours, Princess.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default You're definitely the best crowned head around.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default We will prevail or die, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default Einar will be with us, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default Maraike will be with us in life and death.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default May Arun guide us all.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default Justice will be served, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC You should rest and prepare yourselves.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default Sleep, now? There's no time!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC You really should start admitting that you don't know everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default Did she just...stop time?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default This is unnatural.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default I wont' be able to sleep now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default You know what's at stake. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default We'll need to be ready for anything.
Narration/&Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently...
Narration/&Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC Didn't see a difference.
Narration/&Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal Nice to meet you, too.
Narration/&Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal And who might you be, lady?
Narration/&Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC Call me Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal That's a peculiar name.
Narration/&Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal So that's not your real name?
Narration/&Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC It's the only name I need.
Narration/&Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC Tell me something.
Narration/&Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?
Narration/&Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal I knew these badges would help eventually.
Narration/&Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal Yes, we are. Interested in joining?
Narration/&Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal We met him.
Narration/&Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC A message, and a gift.
Narration/&Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal Why not go yourself?
Narration/&Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me.
Narration/&Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal A personal matter?
Narration/&Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang He cheated on you or something?
Narration/&Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal Sounds like a sensitive topic.
Narration/&Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC I'd rather not go into detail. 
Narration/&Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang What's the gift?
Narration/&Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal What do we need to take back?
Narration/&Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC A longsword.
Narration/&Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal Not too heavy. We could do that.
Narration/&Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal But what's the reward?
Narration/&Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC Ah - real heroes!
Narration/&Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC I can give you the location of a... treasure.
Narration/&Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case...
Narration/&Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2 Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside.
Narration/&Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC But it's full of monsters. Too many for me.
Narration/&Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal We could team up.
Narration/&Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC I've... lost the taste for adventuring.
Narration/&Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC Do we have a deal?
Narration/&Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC Sure.
Narration/&Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC Not interested.
Narration/&Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC Fine, what's the message?
Narration/&Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse Sorry. We have more important things to do.
Narration/&Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept As you wish.
Narration/&Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife45_Any_Normal Alright... we'll tell him that.
Narration/&Mertonswife46_Any_Formal Fine, we'll take your message to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map.
Narration/&Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal Farewell, Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal Hello, Arwin.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC Arwin? We're friends now? 
Narration/&Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC I'll keep calling you kid, I think.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal Whatever.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal Suit yourself.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal We've been to Coparran - ring a bell?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal I suppose you know the name Coparran.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC You bet.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal Apparently you are indebted to someone there.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC Really?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal Something to do with her mood, maybe.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal She said you owe her...a child.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC She's crazy.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC Yeah...thanks for the message.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal Want to tell us what this is about?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal Maybe you would like to share a story with us?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC No. I don't.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal You didn't take her child away from her?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal Alright. It's none of our business.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal She gave us this for you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC What?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC I don't believe it!
Narration/&Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC She went back for it...
Narration/&Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal Feel more like talking now?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC Get out!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default We're getting by.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default Did you hear about a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC Sure - if you're ready to die!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default We're not green any more, Merton.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC At first I tried to help. No one ever came back.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC So I decided to stop talking about it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC I felt...well...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default Responsible for their deaths?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC Responsible? No - they paid for their folly.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default Are we bothering you?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC You're always bothering me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default Let's go.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC Oh, don't be so sensitive!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC All right - the temple is real. I've seen it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default You have?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default And you didn't raid it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC Well, ten of us found the place...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC ...when I was the only one left, I came home.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default The other nine died?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC Slaughtered. All of them.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC Still interested?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default You think we're not strong enough?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC ...maybe with me...you'd have a chance.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default You'd come with us?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC You'd never find it, for a start.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default Are you after the treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC Who says there's a treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC There's a monster - I know that.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC What is it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC That, I don't know.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default Fair enough.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default Sure.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC Good for you!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal Did you change your mind?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC No, no. I'm ready!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC Let's go!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparran first.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal Oh - unfinished business, maybe?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC You know exactly what business.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal So how about the quest?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC Your map has a location called Caer Elis.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal It's just an old Manacalon name.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC I'll be waiting for you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal What if we don't come?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC Then damn the lot of you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal What we get there before you do?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC Ha, ha! As if you could!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC See you there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal He's crazy. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal And we're going with him.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC See? I told you I'd be here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal What have you been doing?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC Catching up with wildlife.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC It used to be my thing.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal Camping in the Badlands? Really?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC Behind the mist.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal We're through the mist!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal Einar will guide us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal Maraike is with us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal Pakri will clear our minds.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal Arun will guide our hearts.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal No pain, no gain.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal Thanks for the encouragement.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC Just saying...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal We did it !
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC Yeah, we did!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC There's still the big one, in there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal Sure. It's not over yet.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal Was there really a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal I think I know what this was:
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal A temple of Arivad!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal Einar protect us!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal Not before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal Before he was corrupted. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal His good side became Einar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is...evil.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal Whatever took place within these walls happened a millenium ago.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal Such evil never fully disappears.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal Well, then - let's clean the place up!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC Well, I must say...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC You're the best team I ever had.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal Thanks!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC Now, it's time to take your reward.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal You're leaving?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal Mysterious.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal Crazy but...a damn good ranger.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal He's going back to that Bitterroot woman.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal That's none of our business. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal Indeed. That chest on the other hand...
Narration/&TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default Look at that...
Narration/&TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default ...the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default This is a there's nothing left of the old Empire.
Narration/&TheAerElai4_Authority_Default All right, people - we're not here for the view.
Narration/&TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default This wind...it's not natural.
Narration/&TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across.
Narration/&TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default So, falling would be a bad idea, then.
Narration/&TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default We've been through worse.
Narration/&TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default Watch out!
Narration/&TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default What kind of creature lives in a place like this?
Narration/&TheAerElai11_Nature_Default You got it: fire spiders.
Narration/&TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default Over there! Soraks!
Narration/&TheAerElai13_Einar_Default They don't need to hide, here.
Narration/&TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default They're not paying attention. What are they doing?
Narration/&TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default Dropping gigantic bones into lava?
Narration/&TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default Why?
Narration/&TheAerElai17_Nature_Default They're not just any bones...
Narration/&TheAerElai18_Nature_Default ...those are dragon bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default How many dragons died here?
Narration/&TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them.
Narration/&TheAerElai21_Authority_Default There's no other way - we need to get up there!
Narration/&TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default Without being shot at, preferably?
Narration/&TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default More dragon bones?
Narration/&TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!
Narration/&TheAerElai25_Authority_Default They were destroying the bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default How do you know?
Narration/&TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default The bones are a threat to them!
Narration/&TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default I don't follow.
Narration/&TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default Dragons? All of them?
Narration/&TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons.
Narration/&TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default Even the Magister.
Narration/&TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default And his bones are among those.
Narration/&TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default I thought I felt something, but...
Narration/&TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default Definitely.
Narration/&TheAerElai36_Authority_Default We need to search the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai37_Any_Default Here!
Narration/&TheAerElai38_Any2_Default A tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai39_Any3_Default It calls to me...
Narration/&TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC Let me...touch my Crown...
Narration/&TheAerElai41_Any_Default Did you hear that?
Narration/&TheAerElai42_Any2_Default I did.
Narration/&TheAerElai43_Any3_Default He wants to touch the Crown.
Narration/&TheAerElai44_Any4_Default The tooth? Just one little tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai45_Any3_Default That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai46_Any2_Default What will happen if we succeed?
Narration/&TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC Let me...touch my Crown...
Narration/&TheAerElai48_Authority_Default There's only one way to find out.
Narration/&TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default This place never ends!
Narration/&TheAerElai50_Any2_Default This is the way - I can hear the Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai51_Any3_Default Yes! We must go on!
Narration/&TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default Are we walking into some gigantic trap?
Narration/&TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!
Narration/&TheAerElai54_Authority_Default Come on - don't falter now!
Narration/&TheAerElai55_Any_Default This is it - the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default Is it open again?
Narration/&TheAerElai57_Any_Default Hard to say. 
Narration/&TheAerElai58_Any_Default I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting.
Narration/&TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default And no god.
Narration/&TheAerElai60_Any_Default The Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai61_Any_Default They're doing it - the damn ritual!
Narration/&TheAerElai62_Any_Default This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die.
Narration/&TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default Einar guide us!
Narration/&TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default Maraike watch over us!
Narration/&TheAerElai65_AcolyteArun_Default Arun lights our way!
Narration/&TheAerElai66_AcolytePakri_Default Justice will prevail!
Narration/&TheAerElai67_Highclass_Default For all my ancestors, I shall not fail!
Narration/&TheAerElai68_Sellsword_Default To the bitter end!
Narration/&TheAerElai69_Lowlife_Default Let's make this bitch pay once and for all.
Narration/&TheAerElai70_Spy_Default Let's neutralize this guy.
Narration/&TheAerElai71_Academic_Default If we were destined to fail, we would have perished already.
Narration/&TheAerElai72_Philosopher_Default We'll venture where no one has been before!
Narration/&TheAerElai73_Lawmaker_Default This chaos will end - today!
Narration/&TheAerElai74_Any_Default We did it!
Narration/&TheAerElai75_Any2_Default The Magister!
Narration/&TheAerElai76_Any2_Default He's coming back to life!
Narration/&TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC Hold.
Narration/&TheAerElai78_Any3_Default What?
Narration/&TheAerElai79_Any4_Default The Rift, it's open!
Narration/&TheAerElai80_Any3_Default No! 
Narration/&TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC HOLD.
Narration/&TheAerElai82_Any_Default I though that was it!
Narration/&TheAerElai83_Any2_Default He said hold! We need to hold!
Narration/&TheAerElai84_Any_Default Against a whole army?
Narration/&TheAerElai85_Any3_Default Look!
Narration/&TheAerElai86_Any3_Default He's closing the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai87_Authority_Default Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!
Narration/&TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC I was right about you.
Narration/&TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC I must go, now.
Narration/&TheAerElai90_Magister_NPC Take care of Solasta. Take care of your world.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default Hello Annie.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC You're back! How did it go?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC Oh. Who's in charge, then?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC I see.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default You're welcome.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default We wanted to talk about Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC I'm all ears.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default No one's there anymore…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC Ah, you want to claim the place?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default How does it work again?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default We can't promise you it's safe.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC It never is.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default What do we do next?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC Once we've done our work, I'll let you know.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC You'll just have to come by and collect your share.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01 I think… this is what the Crown showed me.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02 So, not one of the gems?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03 Obviously.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04 Do you feel anything else?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05 Yes.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06 Alright - let's go, then.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07 I'm afraid not.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08 That's a problem.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09 Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC I have great need of you, my friends.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default What's going on?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default Oh, where?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC So they started exploring.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC One of them came back yesterday...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC ...he had lost an arm.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC Alas, Telema is many days from here.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default Do you think they're still alive?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC If they're alive, bring them back.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC If not... I'll send for their bodies.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC That would make you part of the family, I promise.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default All right, let's hope we find them alive.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default Good old Hector, eh?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default Soraks?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default At least we saved two of them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default The best ones, I'm sure.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default Shut up!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default Let's go back and tell Annie.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC My friends, you did it!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default Lena and Dek are already here?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default So they told you about Hector.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC Yes. Another friend lost...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default You mean Arwin Merton?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default Actually, we found proof that it was.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC Oh... and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default We must go, Annie. See you!
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC You could say that.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC Not boss of much, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default One?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC She's around somewhere. You might run into her.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC Oh, really?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC Tell me where. We'll take care of it.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC The law provides, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri2_Pakri_Default Pakri preserve us!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri4_Priestess_NPC May the owl watch over you, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri3_Priestess_NPC May you find the answers you seek, adventurers.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike1_Priest_NPC There's life yet, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike2_Maraike_Default Maraike smile on you!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike3_Priest_NPC Lady of life! A follower of the goddess.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC Walk in life, adventurers.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC Ah - deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default Clear skies, lady mayor!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default A companion of the third enlightenment!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC Ah yes, this matter for the Council! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default What matter? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default A weighty matter indeed!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC I am cleared to hear everything! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default Well… it all began at Caer Lem…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal Clear skies, master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC Clear skies to you!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC Yes, indeed! I would like more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC …details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal Certainly. How goes your research?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC You gave me much to consider. But I need more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC …hence this invitation
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC Did you witness it first hand?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal Alas, quite often! When they fight…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC But why, why so much suffering? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC He expects them to spread terror…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal …so he can influence and…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal …pervert humans… control them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC Humans, you say? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal Yes - others seem less susceptible…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal … from what we understand of them!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC Fascinating…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal Does it help?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC Oh, yes, very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC Thank you very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal Until next time, then, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default Clear skies, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC We live in fascinating times!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default Too true!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC So, about our last meeting… 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default Still troubled, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC Yes, indeed.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC I have had occasion to witness… certain things.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default What things?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC …they reminded me of what you said.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default Master! You're scaring me, now!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default Of course!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default You realize something very bad might be happening to him?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC Clear skies, senior deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default Why do you call us that? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default I knew there was some treachery afoot here!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default What?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default You'd better explain yourself quickly!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default They're here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC But instead, he changed me!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good. 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC And I won't let any harm come to him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default How can we believe you?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC I am not the danger! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default And?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default What do you want? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC …and Galeafin must disappear to be safe.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default Do you truly want to leave, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default Very well, we shall come when you send for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default Is it time?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default And once inside?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC Wait for my signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC And until then, let me speak.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC State your business!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC Glory of souls!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC Power to the One!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC We're running late! Are we the last?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC Yes! All are awaiting your guest.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC New recruits.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC It's one at a time, you know the rules!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC Indeed, I know them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER Follow me to the basement.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER Let me guess - that was the signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default Or scared to death!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default Where's Illoreth?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default Farewell, Master.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default May your wisdom serve you well, now.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default What's this? A shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default That someone ruined their own shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default Maybe it was just the cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default There's a small chest, here.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC Clear skies! Yes, thanks for coming so quickly!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC Remember that monastery near Coparann?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default The Tirmarian ruins? Of course.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC There was a cemetery there.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to talk to you about it.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC I shall go to him right away! Clear skies! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC Clear skies! Einar guards you all! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC Ah, there you are!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC Many thanks for coming! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC It's about the Sunblaze Monastery.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default We're all ears!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default And?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC The heads of the Church searched for him for years.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC Then he was thought to be lost, either left on the home world…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC …or killed in the Cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default A sad tale, for sure.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default A sign?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC He might have cursed his own symbol.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC The souls of his brothers also wander, somewhere in this land.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC Someone must go and cleanse their remains with holy water.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default Will that suffice?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC Not if Emtan is indeed cursed - his soul will be too angry.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default And if he doesn't listen to reason? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC Then - and only then - you will have to destroy him. 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default We will do what is necessary.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC May Arun's fire warm your heart! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default Clear skies!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default Did we forget to close the door on our last visit? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default Never opened it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default Well, someone's dropped by!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default Not many remains left for the prayer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default You had to say it! Get ready, people!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default We're not going to try talking to them first? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default Zombies don't talk!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default No harm in trying, I guess.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default May the light of the gods free your souls!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC There are no gods in this place, fool! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default Do you truly believe that? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default Did they not? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC I prayed and no answer came!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default Yes, it did!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC Liar!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default Did you not have water and the means to grow food?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC Barely!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC We heard them roaming around at night! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC What?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default And yet you survived how many years here? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC But my prayers weren't answered!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC It won't work, you fool!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC Arun! The lord is still here!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC Thank you…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default Yes, all of them are with the gods now! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC And Emtan?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal Saved. He is with Arun.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed We couldn't bring him back. He's gone.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC You? I know you!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default What?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC You were at the embassy! An aide or something… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC You can't fool me, I never forget a face.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default What's going on, friend?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default Never mind.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default Anything we should know?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default Old story.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default I agree.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC Who goes there?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default I'd like to see ambassador Crawley.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC Council business?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default Inaudible
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC Follow me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default Just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default Shut up and follow.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default Nice to see you, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC Can't say I expected your visit.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC And?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC Seems to?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default He's pretty eager to pin it on me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC We can't let that happen.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default That's why I'm here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC Them?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default Friends. Trustworthy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC You have to take him out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC I can suggest a course of action.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default Oh, is that all?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default I might.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default It looks like you have this all figured out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC I always plan for every contingency.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC We should go.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC Then this time it's farewell for good.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default This is crazy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal That's not an embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal Just not its best side.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang Mind your own business. This way. Stay low.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal This is it.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal Let's hope this works.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang Let's get out of here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC Greetings, colleague.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC Sure. What can I do for you?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default You know Lord Belmont?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC Ambassador Belmont? Of course.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC Nice. What's the catch?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default I need you to release it right away.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC Right now? No long-term leverage?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC I'll need you to do something for me, then.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default I'm listening.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC I need them dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default We're not murderers.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default Enough to die, just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default Hey! Any news?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default Good! I knew I could depend on you.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC Pleasure working with you, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default See you, Daliat.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default Is Lord Belmont around?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC He had to… return home.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default In a rush?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC Indeed.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default Thank you, Ravensworth.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal That'd be me. Who wrote me?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal Clear skies! What's it all about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN What events?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN Their deaths?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal A house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC They were shrewd and successful. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC So the house belongs to you now, I guess! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal What events? What are you talking about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal How did they die?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth They died right after the siege. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword After? Not during? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth No… I… How can I put this?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success They were… responsible. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail Come on - spit it out!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword What? No! How? Who said? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth That's the hardest part.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword What do you mean?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword What? Me? How?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword What does that mean, "resist temptation"? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure Bribery?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_1_Sellsword_Slang Clear skies to you, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal Thanks, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang Clear skies, Master Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_2_AlanMiller_NPC Clear skies! What can I do for you? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_3_Sellsword_Normal Here - from Sergeant Nikannen!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_4_AlanMiller_NPC I see! Give me a moment, I just need to go into the archives.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_5_AlanMiller_NPC Here you go! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal Thanks! Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal Nice house!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal Let's go inside!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal I got something.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal Some stuff, and a note…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default Soraks!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default So they're involved, for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default I'll find the rest and kill them!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Clear skies! Did you go to the house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal Yes - and I found this note!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Interesting - and surprising!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal Surprising? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal Anyway, this was written by the real spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC So what?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang Good luck finding the writer!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal Yes, that's it! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC What do you mean? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal The note - the writing reveals the spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal Because they wanted to keep me safe!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal So we have our list of suspects!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC Exactly!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC Clear skies! What can I do for you today? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal We need to consult the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC Ah, you're too smart for you own good.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC Ah - I was expecting you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default Ceannard. 
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC To think the Soraks were already here…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC …manipulating me…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default It's in the past.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default Though I'd like you to restore my family's name.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC The paperwork is under way.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default Thank you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC Someone came to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default Me? Who?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default Everything all right?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default Like she said - an old acquaintance.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default How are you, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC It's nice that you pretend to care…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default Are you going to hate me forever?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC I don't hate you. I just…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC …well, it was your right to leave and…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC …pursue a life of adventure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC Even if it wastes your academic talent.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default It serves me well, thanks to you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC Times have been hard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC The Guild offered me a posting… south.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default You're not getting your department chair?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC That's why I wanted to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC There is an old Tirmarian tower there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default Oh, yes. Very impressive, too.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC If I could just explore it - bring something back…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC Something the Guild couldn't ignore…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC I would have a chance at this chair.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default …and that's us.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC It could salvage my career!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default Of course. I owe you that much, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default Clear skies, friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC Clear skies, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN How's business in Caer Lem?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN What's your name?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN Did you find the secret passage?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN Have you seen Master Dackin?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC Still, there's been no sign of them since…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC …so we mostly pretend it didn't happen.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default Huh - good for you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC I'm Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default Good to meet you, Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC They must have dug a little too hard in there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default I'm sure we can solve this little problem.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC The Antiquarian? Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC He's in the courtyard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC He's been staring at the tower…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC …trying to figure a way to get up there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC But he can't fly… wait, can he?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default Seems not.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC There you are!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default Are you ready for this?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC I am. Any idea how to get up there?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default One or two.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC I tried to think of a way, but…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC …still, this place is incredible!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default As a matter of fact, I did.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default Let's get to it, if you don't mind.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC You must have seen so much!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default I have. But this is still…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC …fascinating.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default Let's look around.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default Gather all the antiques we can.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC By all the gods!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC This is really something. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default It explains the library we found down in the caves.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC The place seems… dangerous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default Definitely. Be ready for a fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC Wait - you know me. I don't fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default Are you all right, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC I am… alive, or so it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default Those are quite common in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC Just tell me there's something valuable down here!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default Oh, I think you'll be happy.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC …And thank you. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default You're welcome, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC Stay in the light, my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default You, too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC Hey! Interested in a little side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default What kind of side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC The kind that takes particular skills and contacts.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default Say what you mean - the underworld, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC And there I was trying to be discreet.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC Tell her I sent you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default Merton says you got a problem.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC Uh… Arwin…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC What makes you think you can help?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default Not saying I can, yet. But I know people.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC People who can track down stolen goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default What kind of goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC A sword. Imperial.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default Probably? What does it probably do?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC Never got a chance to find out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default You offering a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC I'll make it worth your while.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC Very funny.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default Hey, Nel! Still laughing?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC Like Misaye herself! You?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC For?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default A nice antique sword with three diamonds.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default Hear anything?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC Something. Talk to Gorim.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default So that's your former life, walking the streets?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default And cutting the throats of people who crossed me.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default A very particular one.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC How particular?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default Sound familiar?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC Too expensive for me. I turned him down.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default He have a name?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC The Arcaneum has money.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Gorim_NPC Thank me by buying something.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Lowlife_Default Another time, but I will.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Gorim_NPC I'll remember!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern1_Karel_NPC Hey, Karel!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default Back again?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC The Arcaneum guy?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default I've been looking for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN You have a stolen sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Let's make a deal.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN You're in trouble.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1 Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2 You have a sword that doesn't belong to you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success Listen, I don't want any trouble… 
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure You deaf or something? I said, get lost!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1 You're waiting for someone to buy a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2 Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success How do you…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2 Doesn't matter.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2 What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3 It had better be a pretty big favor.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure …and get paid too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1 It's about that very nice sword…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2 …that you're thinking of selling…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3 …to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2 What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3 What?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4 You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5 …and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6 The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7 Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8 I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1 Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern38_Thief_NPC The Council? Oh, come on…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern39_Thief_NPC It's in Misaye's temple for safekeeping.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern40_Thief_NPC Ask Nel for a bowl of soup.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Lowlife_Default Nel? I just talked to him… I should have known…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Cynical_Default Bowl of soup? That's the worst password I've ever heard!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple1_Lowlife_Default Hey, Nel. So, I'm supposed to ask you for, uh…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple2_Nel_NPC A bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple3_Lowlife_Default You knew? 
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple4_Nel_NPC Of course! Misaye sees all!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple5_Lowlife_Default And you didn't tell me because…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple6_Nel_NPC This was more fun!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple7_Lowlife_Default For you and Misaye, I'm sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple8_Lowlife_Default Well, I won't be a grouch about it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple9_Nel_NPC Aww! Misaye loves to tease a grouch!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple10_Nel_NPC Ask properly!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple11_Lowlife_Default Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple12_Nel_NPC Rules are rules!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple13_Lowlife_Default Rules - you? Oh, wait - only when it's fun, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple14_Nel_NPC You're learning!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple15_Lowlife_Default All right, then. chaplain Nel - may I please have a bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple16_Nel_NPC Of course! It's in that chest.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple17_Lowlife_Default This locked chest? I should have known.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple18_Lowlife_Default Got it!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple19_Lowlife_Default I can't get it…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple20_Nel_NPC Make a donation to Misaye for luck?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple21_ChoiceA_WRITTEN <i>Give 1 gold piece</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_Lowlife_Default Take it, you crook.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple23_Lowlife_Default I don't think so.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple24_Nel_NPC Your coin made Misaye smile!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple25_Nel_NPC Try again, Misaye will help, this time.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple26_Lowlife_Default Still nothing!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple27_Nel_NPC Maybe you need to be more generous!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple28_Nel_NPC You probably used the wrong number…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple29_ChoiceA_WRITTEN <i>Give 5 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_Nel_NPC Fine. Let's hope your skills are up to it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple31_Nel_NPC Have you trained in your skills since the last time?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple32_Nel_NPC You're welcome. Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceG_WRITTEN <i>Give 200 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceF_WRITTEN <i>Give 100 gold pieces</i>

Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest90_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC You're back! Did you get it?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest91_Scavengers2_Lowlife_Default Here! And you mentioned a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest92_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC Beside my undying gratitude? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest1_Lawkeeper_Default Hey, shorty! You in the army?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest2_Stig_NPC Don't call me that! I'm a Royal Guard, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest3_Lawkeeper_Default You… really? The Princess, and all?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest4_Stig_NPC Yeah. Those your friends?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest5_Friendly_Default We are. How do you know each other?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest6_Stig_NPC You didn't tell them?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest7_Stig_NPC We were in the City Guard together.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest8_Lawkeeper_Default And we both… upgraded.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC Anyway, I need help.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest10_Stig_NPC I think someone's rotten in the Guard.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest11_Selfpres_Default That's reassuring…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest12_Pragmatic_Default We have important things to do, mind you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default Hey, Stig is my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest14_Pragmatic_Default Fine.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest15_Stig_NPC I need to go. Meet me at the Palace entrance when you… have time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest16_Lawkeeper_Default Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest17_Stig_NPC Hey, there. You ready?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest18_Lawkeeper_Default Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest21_Any So, what can we do to help?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest22_Stig_NPC I have four suspects. Here are their names and posts.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest23_Stig_NPC It won't be easy.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest24_Stig_NPC They mustn't know I suspect them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest25_Lawkeeper_Default We'll check them out - no problem!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest26_Stig_NPC Strike true!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge27_Cynical_Default All right. Stig says he should be leaving soon.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge28_Lawful_Default There he goes. Let him get a head start.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge29_Lawful_Default …let's find a spot with a good view and wait for the night.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default Now that's a conspiracy!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default There might be an angry husband.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default It might be worth an arrest.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default Shut up!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance34_Friendly_Default Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance35_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC I know you - you're the Sorak killers!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance36_Lawkeeper_Default Anything you want to share… off the books?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance37_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC What?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance38_Lawkeeper_Default A little business of yours.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance39_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC Oh. Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance40_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC Not here, though. Meet me at the promontory, tonight.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance41_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC Quiet place. I like it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance42_Lawkeeper_Default So, what have you got?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance43_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC In a rush, eh? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance44_Lawkeeper_Default Booze? Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance45_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC Hey, you asked for it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance46_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC My boss would kill me for selling New Empire liquor.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance47_Lawkeeper_Default This isn't illegal?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance48_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC Of course not! Just… you know… Imperial. Slaver stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance49_Lawkeeper_Default Never mind. Our mistake. Sorry to waste your time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk50_Drunk_NPC This is my seat!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk51_Drunk_NPC I always sit here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk52_Drunk_NPC You're a strange bunch, you know that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk53_Drunk_NPC Even stranger than that Arwin Merton.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk54_Drunk_NPC Are you gonna say something?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk55_Drunk_NPC Knew it. You Council pawns are fake.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk56_Drunk_NPC Killed Soraks? Right. And I've got a dragon in my pocket.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk57_Drunk_NPC Now you're pissing me off.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk58_Lawkeeper_Default Well, I'm not sure he's smart enough to be corrupt.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk59_Any_Default Think he can work? He can barely stand!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk60_Any_Default Let's go and see, then.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk61_Lawkeeper_Default What is he doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk62_Partner_Default Hijacking a crate from a delivery.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk63_Lawkeeper_Default Let's see what's in it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk64_Lawkeeper_Default Flowers?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk65_Herbalism_Default Angry Violets, hundreds of them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk66_Drunk_NPC Hey! What are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk67_Persuasion_WRITTEN We just want a share of the loot.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk68_Intimidation_WRITTEN You're clearly a thief - admit it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk69_Deception_WRITTEN We're investigating you for Captain Ironshell.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE We caught you red-handed. Just confess.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk74_Intimidation_FAIL You're a bunch of idiots, I'll confess that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk75_Deception_FAIL Captain Ironshell asked us to investigate you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk76_Drunk_FAIL Oh yeah? That's a good one. She asked me to bring this to the Palace.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk77_Default_FAIL The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk78_Drunk_FAIL My job. What did you think I was doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk79_Lawkeeper_Default Why did you pick this crate out of the delivery?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk80_Drunk_NPC Oh, this one? 
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk81_Drunk_NPC Let me think. 
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk82_Drunk_NPC This is for her Royal Highness, going through Captain Ironshell directly.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk83_Drunk_NPC I'm sure the Princess will appreciate you rummaging around her personal stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default I knew that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC Ask the Captain. Go right ahead.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default That won't be necessary. Carry on.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC Rodric isn't here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC Rodric? He's on an errand.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple90_Any_Default Nothing. We're wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple91_Lawkeeper_Default This Rodric, though - where is he?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple92_Any_Default Let's check again.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple93_Lawkeeper_Default You're Rodric?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple94_Alrin_NPC Who's asking?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple95_Lawkeeper_Default We're Council deputies…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End96_Any_Default What was that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End97_Any_Default He's not just a Guard, that's for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End98_Arcana_Default That's a shadowcaster trick! He can't be far!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End99_Lawkeeper_Default Look for tracks.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default What have you found?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End102_Any_Default Enough to implicate Rodric and his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End103_Any_Default They were smuggling goods in and out of the Temple Quarter.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End104_Lawkeeper_Default Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End105_Stig_NPC I heard what happened! Rodric's a shadowcaster?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End106_Lawkeeper_Default Rodric's a corpse. He attacked us with a bunch of his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End108_Stig_NPC Fantastic! Thanks for the help, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End109_Lawkeeper_Default Stay in the light, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start1_Mayor_NPC A moment, if you please, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start2_Aristocrat_Default Lady Bright-Spark? How may we help you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start3_Mayor_NPC You could start by not calling me that.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start4_Aristocrat_Default As you wish.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start5_Mayor_NPC I have a messy business on my desk, and your name's on it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start6_Aristocrat_Default My name?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start7_Mayor_NPC It's an inheritance…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start8_Mayor_NPC …with a bunch of people contesting the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start9_Aristocrat_Default What? Who died?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start10_Mayor_NPC The honorable Joan Tannerson.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start11_Aristocrat_Default Oh. I see.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start12_Anyother_Default Family?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start13_Aristocrat_Default She was… my mentor. A renowned lawyer.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start14_Cynical_Default You're a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start15_Aristocrat_Default Do I look like a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default Wouldn't put it past you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default What is the mess, exactly?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start18_Mayor_NPC Tannerson left you everything, according to the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start19_Mayor_NPC Her children aren't happy, and the notary is very… annoying.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start20_Mayor_NPC So please - do something. Anything. Just make them stop harassing me.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start21_Mayor_NPC I have more important things to deal with.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start22_Aristocrat_Default Perhaps I should talk to the children first.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start23_Mayor_NPC Do whatever you want, as long as it shuts this notary up!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start24_Aristocrat_Default Right. Thank you… my lady.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start25_Mayor_NPC Tsss…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew11_Aristocrat_Default Drew! How are you holding up?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew12_Drew_NPC Look - it's the famous heir. Should I bow?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default Listen, I have no idea…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default Can we talk?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default He needs a smack in the mouth.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew18_Aristocrat_Default He's… grieving.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew19_Violent_Default I'll give him something to grieve over.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria11_Aristocrat_Default Lyria, I'm so very sorry for your loss.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria12_Lyria_NPC Oh - you're the… well… I knew she liked you, but…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria13_Aristocrat_Default Frankly, this all seems like a prank.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria14_Lyria_NPC Right? That's what I told the notary.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria15_Lyria_NPC Goodbye.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria16_Lowlife_Default These people!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria11_Aristocrat_Default Adria! How are you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria12_Adria_NPC Well, sad, of course. You?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria13_Aristocrat_Default Thanks for asking. A bit down, of course.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria14_Aristocrat_Default She taught me so much.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria15_Adria_NPC I know. She was proud of you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria16_Aristocrat_Default Thank you. 
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria17_Aristocrat_Default Listen - this will. It bothers me…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria18_Aristocrat_Default …I really don't want to quarrel with you and your siblings.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria19_Adria_NPC I'm afraid you won't have a choice.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default What would you do with the inheritance?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria112_Adria_NPC Me? Share it with the two other sharks, just to stay alive.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria113_Aristocrat_Default Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack1_Anyother_Default They're not bandits.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack2_Aristocrat_Default No. More like hired assassins.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack3_Anyother_Default You know what this means.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack4_Aristocrat_Default Stay alert. The notary's mansion might not be safe either.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending1_Cynical_Default Oh, look - they're all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC So you left Caer Cyflen without a word. 
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending3_Drew_NPC How rude.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending4_Aristocrat_Default Can we take this inside?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending5_Lyria_NPC Just tell us what you decided and stop wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default The Circle of Danantar will reward you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default Adria?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending12_Drew_NPC What? Did the Soraks replace you or something?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending13_Lyria_NPC Even from you, Drew, that's low.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending14_Notary_NPC Ah, so you are all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending15_Notary_NPC Why didn't you come in?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending16_Aristocrat_Default You're right. Let's finish this.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending17_WRITTEN_ChoiceA The inheritance is mine.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending18_WRITTEN_ChoiceB <i>Choose an heir from among the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending19_WRITTEN_ChoiceC <i>Split the inheritance four ways.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending20_WRITTEN_ChoiceD <i>Split the inheritance between the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending21_Aristocrat_ChoiceA Your mother left me everything. Her will should be respected.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending22_Aristocrat_ChoiceC We'll split the inheritance between the four of us.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending23_Aristocrat_ChoiceD You should each get a third of the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending24_WRITTEN_ChoiceE <i>Give the inheritance to Lyria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending25_WRITTEN_ChoiceF <i>Give the inheritance to Drew.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending26_WRITTEN_ChoiceG <i>Give the inheritance to Adria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending27_Aristocrat_ChoiceE I'll give Lyria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending28_Aristocrat_ChoiceF I'll give Drew the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending29_Aristocrat_ChoiceG I'll give Adria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending30_Lyria_NPC Excellent!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending31_Drew_NPC By all the gods...
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending32_Drew_NPC Yes!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending33_Lyria_NPC What? Why?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending34_Adria_NPC Thank you! I'll share with you both, you know it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC Well, that's settled, then.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC I will magically seal the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC I'm sorry, the law forbids it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC Fine… I thought I had cracked you…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default What?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default She killed all her siblings?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default Maybe she was a Sorak agent?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default They were all my childhood friends…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default Oh, yes. Sorry.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default It's over. Let's go.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default Who's this? Seems to like wolves.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE Let's kill them!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE Let's get out of here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default Out here, there's no such thing as "can't hurt." 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE Hello!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success Not much. What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default Hey, you! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success What do you know about that castle over there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure Ha! Aren't you tough?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure Believe me, you don't want me coming over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure Now get lost, before I change my mind!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE How strong is the garrison?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE Who is its ruler?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC No.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default And there's no one else outside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default Mostly?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default Probably undead? Why do you say that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit Thanks, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC Talbut.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal Look! What's that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE Let's destroy it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE Let's keep moving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE We have questions.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal Hello! Could we ask you some questions?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default And the other?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC …and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default Is there anyone else?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default How can we help you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal Now, that's just rude. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal Well, that's just you all over!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal You can rely on us.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi …but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal Now, that's what I call work ethic.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi …I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi …and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman Yes - what is it?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default We have something for you. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi Or rather, someONE.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman Your report?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi …so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi Capital! We're distant cousins, you know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman No, I didn't.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC You there! Stop! Don't move!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC Who are you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE We should leave.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE We should attack.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE We should negotiate.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE We should trick him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default Will you at least hear us before we go?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal …long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal …the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure I may be dead, but I'm not stupid.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2 The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC Take your lies and get out!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure You want to steal from him, more like!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal No - I swear…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC Who are you? What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE Ask for mercy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE To destroy you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE To meet your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE To make a deal.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal What we want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC I know this place. You don't. Let's trade.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal All right - talk.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure Who do you think you're dealing with? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC That tough act may impress the girls back home…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2 …but I've seen scarier things in the mirror.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2 There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal What things?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure You must think I'm a complete idiot.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal …as long as you don't do it to us, of course.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal But the thing is, we've come a very long way…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2 …and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC Really?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC What's it about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2 They come from the very highest level.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2 There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2 If anyone can persuade the master, she can.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal Who's Aksha?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC A defiler. She lives upstairs. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC …and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2 …but they don't sound like him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC I know - knew him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2 He was my mentor, my teacher.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3 She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal So we'll have to go through her? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2 …and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC We've tried using force before, more than once…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2 …but I got sick of losing people. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal Thanks for the warning.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2 Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal …what's the best way to approach him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC Hard to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2 The Cataclysm hit him hard…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3 …and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter We're no one's minions, lady.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE Step away!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE We'll destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE We just want to talk to Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE We can offer you blood.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult We need to speak to your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult You can get out of our way or try to stop us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default We ask a simple boon:
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2 An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default What does that mean - getting sense out of him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure Kill them! Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal (low voice) How about blood?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2 Not mine, of course…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3 …but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal Crazy? What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure You must think I was born yesterday…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2 We need his knowledge.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC You'll see.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure Let me think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2 Keeps raving about gods coming to get him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC The Minor Gate is the only way in.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default Minor Gate?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC Yes. Over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC Who are you? How did you get in here?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default Master Mardracht?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC You know my name! How do you know my name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE Can't you see we're too strong?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE We don't want to kill you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE We want to save Solasta.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default We found you and we breached your defenses.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2 Do you really want to test your power against ours?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default You are right to fear us, and those who sent us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2 We are powerful - but you don't have to die.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default All we ask is that you hear what we have to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2 After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP If you are not here to kill me - then what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal I offer you the chance to buy your life.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2 Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success For my life? I… 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default The gods have commanded us to kill you…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC I knew it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal …but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal We must have the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC The gem… ? But…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2 Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure You have the Crown? No!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2 To destroy Solasta!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2 …specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success But wait - the Crown is active?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2 And it chose you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal Well… Yes. We're not sure why.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2 This is no task for the likes of you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal But… ?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC NOW!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC This is what you came for.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC Take it - and leave me alone!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default The gem's in the castle?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default Maybe. It's in that direction.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default We could just show our Legacy Council credentials.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default …Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default We're not getting in that way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default Could we climb up?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default It's too open. We'd be easy targets.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default We'll have to find another way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default …probably used right up to the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default Everyone knows the undead are deaf!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default Another door.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default Look at the top. What is that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default Looks like a magical shield of some sort.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default Some sort? How many sorts are there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default What we're looking for is up there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default You're sure?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default This could be our way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default …into water that's who knows how deep…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default …and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default This drain could be a way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default That doesn't look right.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default It's a drain. What's wrong with that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default Yes, but inside a building?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default Maybe the roof leaks.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default Unless…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default I swear, if you say something smart…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default I never say anything that's not. But think about it:
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default Are you saying it's a secret entrance?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default The outside graves were likely for servants and guards.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default The most important graves are in the catacombs down below.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default And by "important," you mean "rich."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default So - this is a Minor Gate?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default Did you see any other way to get there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default So we're just going to trust her?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default That looks like a Minor Gate.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default Where do you suppose it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default To the Master's floor, hopefully.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default We've heard how paranoid this Master is.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default So - are we going?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default So that's it?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default Stop it. You know we can't do that.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default We must get it back to the Council.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default Can't blame me for trying.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default Ugh. Teleporting feels weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default I wonder what this Mardracht is like?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default It's a book!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default It's in the common tongue: "The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default Those must be his bones here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default That was the ghost we met earlier! 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default What's this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default You're not as funny as you think you are.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default What's this? 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default What language is this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default Draconic. They say it's older than high elven.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default Well, everyone said he was paranoid.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default Or… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default What? He's a dragon? How would that work?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default That looks weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default It hasn't done anything yet.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default It doesn't work? I wonder…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default Don't. Just don't.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil8_Any_Default I hate you.

Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_2_Pragmatism_Default Better be sure!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_3_Kythaela_NPC Who art thou?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_4_AcademicOrElse_Default Old elvish! We are friends, my lady!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_5_Kythaela_NPC The Master sent you?  
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_6_Any_Default Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_7_Kythaela_NPC How dare you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_8_Pragmatism_Default Dare what? Come outside and look around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_9_Kythaela_NPC But it's… impossible!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_10_Kythaela_NPC Where am I?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_11_Pragmatism_Slang It's called the Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_12_Kythaela_NPC No! I was in the Aer-Elai, the heart of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_13_Kythaela_NPC I must find the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_14_Kythaela_NPC Kythaela, my name is the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_15_Kythaela_NPC …no, my name is Kythaela of the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_16_Kythaela_NPC …whatever this shield might be. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_17_Choice1_WRITTEN Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_18_Choice2_WRITTEN Aer-Elai?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_19_Choice3_WRITTEN A shield?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_20_Choice1_Spoken Which Master are you talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_21_Choice2_Spoken Aer-Elai? The heart of the Empire? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_22_Choice3_Spoken What is this shield you're talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_23_Kythaela_NPC The Master of… I can't remember. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_24_Kythaela_NPC Yes, this tower was in the Aer-Elai, a haven of peace!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_25_Kythaela_NPC The shield is the master, and the master is the shield! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_26_Kythaela_NPC But tell me - what happened? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_27_Any_Default A thousand years ago, the Cataclysm ravaged the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_28_Kythaela_NPC Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_29_Helpfulness_Default My lady, what is the last thing you remember? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_30_Kythaela_NPC I don't remember any Cataclysm… I remember… a large room…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_31_Kythaela_NPC …people speaking about a rift, a great threat to the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_32_Kythaela_NPC …strange creatures with strange powers…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_33_Choice_Academic_WRITTEN You mean THE Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_34_Choice_Academic_Spoken A rift? Do you mean THE rift? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_35_Kythaela_NPC Are there more than one?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_36_Choice2_WRITTEN Creatures? The Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_37_Choice2_Spoken Strange creatures - yes, the Soraks, of course! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_38_Kythaela_NPC No - they were called… humans…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_39_Kythaela_NPC …strange beings, with magic that was not arcane. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_40_Kythaela_ifHumanAdventurer_NPC They actually looked just like you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_41_AcademicOrElse_Default Fascinating! You witnessed a council of war! Can you recall anything else?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_42_Kythaela_NPC One of the beings was wearing THIS Crown, scintillating with gems. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_43_Kythaela_NPC They called him Magister, with the utmost respect! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_44_Kythaela_NPC But you are not him. Where did you find this Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_45_Choice1_WRITTEN You met the Magister?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_46_Choice1_Spoken The Magister? And this was his Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_47_Choice2_WRITTEN Scintillating?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_48_Choice2_Spoken Scintillating with gems, you say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_49_Choice3_WRITTEN We found this Crown.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_50_Choice3_Spoken We found this Crown in another part of the Badlands.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_51_Kythaela_NPC He was wearing it, at least.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_52_Kythaela_NPC Yes. The Crown was set with eight large gems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_53_Kythaela_NPC There are no Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_54_SellswordOrElse_Slang Just look outside, lady! The Badlands are real! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_55_SellswordOrElse_Slang And we had to fight Soraks to get the Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_56_Kythaela_NPC Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_57_Any_Default The scourge of humanity.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_58_Any_Default They ran the humans out of Tirmar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_59_Any_Default …and came here to finish the job!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_60_Kythaela_NPC The humans weren't the enemy? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_61_Choice1_WRITTEN They were refugees!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_62_Choice1_Spoken No! They were refugees, fleeing the Soraks!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_63_Kythaela_NPC Refugees? Eager to join the enlightenment of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_64_AcademicOrElse_Default Slavery isn't enlightenment! Those days died with the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_65_Kythaela_NPC Silence, wretch! The Empire can't be dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_66_Any_NonHighElf_Rude The Empire died with the Cataclysm! And even if it galls me to admit it…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_67_AcademicOrElse_Default …it saved Solasta from a horrible fate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_68_Choice2_WRITTEN They warned the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_69_Choice2_Spoken They convinced the Empire of the real threat.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_70_Kythaela_NPC Those Soraks you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_71_AcademicOrElse_Default Yes! Dangerous, evil lizards, able to wield magic and to subvert minds!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_72_Kythaela_NPC Weak human minds, for sure! And yet…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_73_AcademicOrElse_Default And yet?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_74_Kythaela_NPC Yet I recall an elf, a member of the household, trying to kill the Master…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_75_Choice3_WRITTEN They joined forces.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_76_Choice3_Spoken Their combined forces assaulted the Rift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_77_Kythaela_NPC There was mention of the Rift in the Aer-Elai.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_78_Any_Default They managed to close it - but triggered the Cataclysm, ushering in a dark age!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_79_Kythaela_NPC The dark age? Those Badlands you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_80_Any_NPC Yes! A thousand years of rebuilding after near extinction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_81_Kythaela_NPC It can't be! I still feel the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_82_Kythaela_NPC And I must find him!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_83_Any_Default Times have changed since you last traveled in the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_84_Kythaela_NPC Still, I feel the pull! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_85_Any_Default The pull?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_86_Kythaela_NPC Yes, a pull to get to the Copper Vale of Remembrance! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_87_Kythaela_NPC Take me there at once and I shall name you favored servants!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_88_Crownbearer_Default The Copper Vale of Remembrance? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_89_Kythaela_NPC Yes - a fortress and place of rest for fallen heroes, roughly in this direction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_90_Choice1_WRITTEN The Vale of Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_91_Choice1_Spoken Copper, fortress… hmmm - sounds like the Vale of Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_92_Choice2_WRITTEN We're not your servants.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_93_Choice2_Spoken We are no one's servants, favored or otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_94_Kythaela_NPC Traveling companions, then!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_95_Kythaela_NPC You can tell me of this Cataclysm on our journey!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_96_Choice3_WRITTEN You seem sure we'll agree.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_97_Choice3_Spoken You seem very certain that we'll go with you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_98_Kythaela_NPC Of course - you wouldn't let a lady cross those Badlands alone, surely? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_1Galar_NPC A timely arrival! Many thanks for your help! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_2_Pragmatism_Default Clear skies, friend! What's going on here? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_3Galar_NPC Those… fellows joined my caravan at Coparann…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_4Galar_NPC …a couple of hours ago, this man stumbled on our path, almost dead…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_5Galar_NPC …no healing could help him, so I put him in a tent…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_6Galar_NPC …and I was about to send word to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_7_Choice1Pragmatism_WRITTEN Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_8_Choice1Pragmatism_Spoken Coparann? That's where we're going!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_9Galar_NPC Then perhaps you can do me a favor! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_10_CynicismOrElse_Default A favor? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_11Galar_NPC Of course I'll see that you're rewarded! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_12_Choice2Starter_WRITTEN Almost dead?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_13_Choice2Starter_Spoken Almost dead? Sick? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC No, wounded! Deep wounds…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC …ripped open, as if by sharp claws.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default Claw wounds? And no healing could help him? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC That's right. The wounds were oozing.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC It's a wonder he was still alive.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN Send word? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken Why send word?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default You want us to take word of his death to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_25Galar_NPC Have him countersign the note, then see my agent.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_26Galar_NPC He is the owner of the general store. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_27Galar_NPC Meanwhile, get some rest and share our camp!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_28Galar_NPC We can even sell you some equipment!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_29_ArunFollower_Default Let us share Arun's gifts!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_30_Any_Default Many thanks for your hospitality!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_1_Guard_NPC Halt! Do you seek entrance to our fair valley?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_2_Any_Default Yes, we do!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_3_Guard_Npc Then go see Sergeant Nikannen in the Guardhouse!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_4_Any_Default Thank you! Clear skies! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_5_Guard_NPC Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_6_SgtNikannen_NPC Good day! I am Sergeant Nikannen, officer of the day! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_7_SgtNikannen_NPC What business brings you to Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_8_SellswordChoice1_WRITTEN We found something.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_9_SellswordOrElse_Slang Well, Sarge, we found something of yours on our way here!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_10_SgtNikannen_NPC Of mine? What, exactly?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN We have something for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default We were asked to give you certain items! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC Asked? By whom?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC And what items?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN Galar sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang Here they are, Sarge!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC The ring, the badge, the insignia…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC The man who wore those was of middling height…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC …broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default Correct! You knew him, then?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_24_SgtNikannen_NPC Now, tell me what happened to my good friend Roald!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_25_DiplomatOrElse_Default First, please accept our sincere condolences! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_26_SgtNikannen_NPC Thanks. Now tell me where, when, how - and who!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default Two days ago.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default He was found almost dead by the caravan people.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default They tried to heal him and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default …some travelers in the caravan rushed in…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default …to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC And no idea who those guys were? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default Did Roald say anything to you? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC …but leave Gromnir out of it for now.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN Not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken And why not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC …perhaps we can discuss some more!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default And where is the Ceannard? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC But we need to talk to the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC You won't talk to him without my leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC And here's a note for the Ceannard!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_1_Ceannard_NPC Clear skies! Joris Nikannen says you have an interesting story to tell! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_2_Any_Default Clear skies to you, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC Go on.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC …but Nikannen sent you to me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC …the one old hand who was born here. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC We have known each other almost all our lives!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN The Stonefist company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken The Stonefist mercenary company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN Orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken An orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC …whipped into a frenzy by a shaman.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC They hit us hard and opened a breach…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC …got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken Who's Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN That doesn't answer my question.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken We are agents of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN Mausoleum?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken A place of remembrance?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken What's Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC A very particular kind of marble - very precious! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC The traditional stone for the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC Can they truly possess others?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default Not possess, exactly…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default …what they do is worse…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default …if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC …then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC Not a word about what you told me, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC I'll say no more for the time being!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default Clear skies to you, Ceannard! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC It's rather silly, really. This young man…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC …he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC So? He probably gambled the money away!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC So? Where is this paragon of yours?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC …but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC Why's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC Like an old couple, the two of them!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN We have a letter for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN The Ceannard sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN Let's see your wares.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN We should go.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC Of course, of course!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC Would you be interested in sampling our wares?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default What do you sell?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal The Ceannard sent us to talk to you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal Anything unusual in recent days?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC Well met again!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC What do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN The soldiers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal …posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN These highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal Normally the penalty is clear and swift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp So what do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC Things about Roald and the Baron.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken What about Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC …I was speechless, not out of grief but…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC …because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default You mean… one of them is… not who he seems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN The Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken What about the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC And that's not all…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC Something is wrong. I can feel it. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal Suggestions, Sarge? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC I know what his normal reaction would be…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC …so come back and we can compare notes. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC Clear skies to you! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC Greetings, adventurers. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC Then let her speak for herself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC …he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC With your leave, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC …I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC …otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC Ah - you're back! How did the audience go? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC No - just pragmatic and smart! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC …then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC So, not like Gromnir at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal Fine. What do you suggest? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC …as envoys of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN So, what's the plan?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal We're from the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal Quite the contrary, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal …the Council would appreciate Coparann's help.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC Why didn't you say so yesterday? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal …in a delicate and vital matter.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal And what's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Historical research.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC Those… baubles have some historical value?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC Then why not just say so?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC That would be more than fair, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC Then please lead the way! Where should we start? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC In the basement, my lord! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC Now, back to your post!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC Yes, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere Go. I'll meet you in the basement.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC Here! This is the place! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC …there is something I wish to show you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC You will find it interesting, hopefully.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC So nice of you to drop by. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC And you will tell us everything!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal Einar be your judge! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC And you will give me that Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron Is that… the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC …the Soraks are real.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC This changes our position towards the Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN Warnings?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN About the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN About the Soraks…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken The Council warned you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC If anything, they weren't loud enough!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default But we can only warn! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC True! We won't let our guard down! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default How does this change your position?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC Coparann must stand with the Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Do you plan to join the Council?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Or simply to help us in our endeavors? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC …will allow us to communicate swiftly!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC But enough about matters of state!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC The Ceannard has the right of it! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC That resilience would have amounted to nothing…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC …without your insight and your courage! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal The keys to the town, maybe?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC Go forth on your journey with our blessings!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC This is the place!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal Difficult to read anything here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC Yes!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal Let's head there now! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC Not so fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC The feast is just starting!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC And you will make a nice main dish!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC Master, here I am, at last!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC Kythaela, come to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal Kythaela could use some healing, I think!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC …in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC You have my thanks, whoever you are.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC For reuniting me with Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN Reuniting? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken Reunited with her?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_9_Judgmental_Normal Did you kill her? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal Careful, now!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal Kythaela was your clone? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal I don't understand what happened here!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC A vessel for my knowledge and memories!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal Very high-level magic, then!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_21_ChoiceB_Normal Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_22_Adrasteia_Spoken Yes, the merging process takes time - time during which I was almost helpless!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN Never seen such a creature?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal Never met such a creature before? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC This was a negation of life, an abomination!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_29_AcademicOrElse_Normal You were at the battle of the Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal Misconceptions? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal Oh, that.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC The Empire wasn't kind to… other races.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal The humans surprised you, it seems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_36_Adrasteia_NPC Yes - such bravery, such defiance! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC They all came together to save Solasta! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_39_Adrasteia_NPC The Iron Legions and the Shield Wall of the dwarves…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_40_Adrasteia_NPC …holding the enemy at bay, flank to flank!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC …giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC And, as another wave came through…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC …one last throw of the dice…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC …one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal What was it?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC …but at this moment we resumed our true forms!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_49_Adrasteia_NPC To secure the Rift for a few crucial moments…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_50_Adrasteia_NPC …buying time with our lives in a furnace of magic and steel! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_51_Adrasteia_NPC So Kaseinax finished his ritual!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_52_AcademicOrElse_Normal With the gems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_53_Adrasteia_NPC Take it, old friend, once again.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal Old friend?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal The Magister is still in the Crown? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC Enough talk of the past.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2 I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC …and for that, I will need all my strength.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC2 Use my Gate freely. I believe you know how.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC We shall meet again, before the end!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC2 But before you take your leave, if you would be so kind…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC3 This creature you forced to flee still plagues my grounds with his minions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_61_Adrasteia_NPC Would you deal with them and free their prisoners? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_62_Adrasteia_NPC As a courtesy.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_63_Any_Default We owe you that much. Thank you, Master Adrasteia.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Welcome Welcome to the inn!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_StayForTheNight Sure! Get settled!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Nomoney No coin, no bed.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Goodbye Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_1_Atima_NPC Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_2_Atima_NPC My name is Atima Bladeburn, priestess of Arun.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_3_Arun_Default A herald of fire?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_4_Atima_NPC It is my honor.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_5_Atima_NPC What can I do for you?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_6_Arun_Default Just passing by to pay our respects.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_7_Cynical_Default Not me.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_8_Atima_NPC Then good luck and fair weather, friends.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_9_Any_Default Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_10_Any_Default We need your powers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_1_Ceannard_NPC Gromnir! Thank Einar you're safe! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_2_BaronStonefist_NPC Yes, I am - thanks to Joris and these adventurers, it seems!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_3_Ceannard_NPC Now, old friend - go see Atima with Joris! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_4_BaronStonefist_NPC I'm fine!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_5_Ceannard_NPC I knew you'd say that.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_6_Ceannard_NPC I am the Ceannard, and you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_7_Ceannard_NPC …you shall resume your duties only if our cleric says you're fit enough.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_8_BaronStonefist_NPC But -
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_9_Ceannard_NPC No buts! I shall secure the Keep and the valley till you're back!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_10_Ceannard_NPC As for you, my friends, find Lady Kythaela's belongings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_11_Ceannard_NPC …and meet me in the throne room.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Formal Strike true!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Normal Will do.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_1_CrownbearerOrArcane_Highest_Normal Tell us, Lady Kythaela, what did you find? A gem? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2_Kythaela_NPC This is my spellbook - I remember!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2b_Kythaela_NPC A wand, a robe, some money, and a piece of paper.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_3_CrownbearerOrHighestInsighet_Normal What does it say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_4_Kythaela_NPC I… don't know. There is only one word written on the paper: "Adrasteo"
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_5_SarcasticOrElse_Normal Is that another place?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_6_Kythaela_NPC I… I'm not sure! I feel the pull returning!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_7_InsightOrElse_Normal I guess we'll soon be on the road again, then.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_8_SarcasticOrElse_Normal Visit exotic lands, meet interesting monsters, and kill them! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_9_PerceptionHighest_Normal What about that door? Another secret from Imperial times?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_1_ArcanaHighest_Normal A Major Gate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_2_Sarcastic_Normal About the cleanliness of the rooms in the Residence?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_3_ArcanaHighest_Normal About functional Gates, you dimwit!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_4_Sarcastic_Normal This dusty old room?   
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_5_ArcanaHighest_Normal Yes, look at it! It's perfectly intact.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_8_Kythaela_NPC It is locked, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_9_InsightHighest_Normal How do we unlock it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_10_Kythaela_NPC You need to use its name. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_11_Kythaela_NPC It would normally be engraved nearby, but this was a private, secret Gate.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_12_Pragmatic_Normal So, we can't use it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_13_Kythaela_NPC I know its name, this was my family's.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_14_Pragmatic_Normal So…?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_15_Kythaela_NPC Once you get me to my master, I'll give you the name.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_16_Pragmatic_Normal I guess that's fair.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_17_Friendly_Normal And then, we teleport to Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_18_Friendly_Normal That's fantastic!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_19_Pragmatic_Normal I'm not sure the Ceannard will want to wait.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_20_Kythaela_NPC Then I'll give him the name, but you still have to stay with me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_21_Cynical_Default She's tough, but at least she doesn't sound crazy anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_22_Kythaela_NPC Watch your words, you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_23_Kythaela_NPC …never mind.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_1_Default_Default This is the worst place we've been so far.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_2_Reactor_Normal It sure does stink - sulfur, I think.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_3_Reactor_Slang And it stinks like an orc's backside.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_4_Reactor_Formal Indeed, the smell here is awful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_5_Pragmatic_Default We're deep in the Badlands, sure - but there is a gem around here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_6_Selfpres_Default You never know. Remember the Gem of Abjuration? 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_7_Selfpres_Default The Crown's signal was just a decoy to find Kythaela.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_8_Default_Default Look, is that an orc totem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_9_Default_Default An orc...woman?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_10_Kill_CHOICE Let's kill her!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_11_Save_CHOICE We could save her.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_12_Leave_CHOICE Let's move on.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_13_Speak_CHOICE Let's think about it.

Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_4_Choice1_Default So, who's this old queen?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_5_Kebra_NPC Monster. Strong. Hates light.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_6_Selfpres_Default What kind of monster?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_7_Kebra_NPC Do not know. Plenty go after holy axe, no one comes back to tell.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_8_Selfpres_Default Encouraging...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_9_Selfpres_Default About this so-called holy axe...what is it?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_10_Kebra_NPC Holy axe was of ancestor of orcs, legend says, brought from the Endless Range.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_11_ChoiceA_WRITTEN Ancestors?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_12_ChoiceB_WRITTEN Endless Range?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_13_ChoiceC_WRITTEN Forget it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_14_ChoiceA_Default Orcs have ancestors?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_15_Any_Default Orcs born out from Great Collapse, from its magic.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_16_Any_Default Ancestors were great warriors from the Endless Range.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_17_ChoiceB_Default What's the Endless Range?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_18_History_Default A name for the plains of Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_19_Default_Default Orcs were Tirmarian?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_20_History_Default No.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_21_Any_Default We don't have time for historical debates.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_22_ChoiceC_Default We know enough.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_23_Choice3_Default Let's find this old queen, then.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_1_Default_NPC Webs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_2_Selfpres_NPC Oh, no? That's what the old queen is? Another spider?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_3_Violent_Default We can deal with a spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_4_Default_Default Even two.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_5_Violent_Default But a very, very big deep spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_6_Selfpres_Default Come on! How big can it be?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_7_Cynical_NPC We should bring its head back to the Council. Faisech will love it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_1_Pragmatic_Default What happened?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_2_Arcana_Default It's magical darkness.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_3_Selfpres_Default We need light! It's an extra-super big deep spider!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_4_Default_Default And it has anti-light magic?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_5_Selfpres_Default This is insane! Let's go back!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_6_Selfpres_Default I'd rather kill all the orcs in that damned volcano than walk down this spider pit in the pitch dark.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default There has to be a way.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default I promise, I'll never scoff again at 'anything is possible in the Badlands'.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default At least we got it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default Hopefully that means another orc tribe behind us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default You really want to give up this axe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default Look at it? it's a masterpiece!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_6_Nosy_Default Tirmarian smiths were just as good as the elves of Manacalon!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_7_Nosy_Default This axe is fantastic!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_8_Greed_Default I say we keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_9_Authority_Default The gem's more important - and to get that, we need to give the axe to Bladefang.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_1_Radulf_NPC Brok is back with nyarks?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_2_Radulf_NPC Have the...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_3_WRITTEN_Pragmatic Here, your axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_4_WRITTEN_Greed We'll keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_5_Pragmatic_Default Here it is, your holy axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_6_Radulf_NPC I knew it was real!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_7_Radulf_NPC It is magnificient.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_8_Cynical_Default Nice vocabulary.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_9_Radulf_NPC You made Bladefang more powerful than ever!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_10_Radulf_NPC We follow you against Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_11_Greed_Default It was too hard to get it, it's ours, now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC But axe is orc inheritance.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default It's Tirmarian, not orc.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC Leave Bladefang. Now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default Look at that! Another library!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default But it's makeshift, not Manacalon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC Home of Sandraven, and shaman Urka.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN Why the Manacalon style?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN Tell us about Sandraven tribe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_7_Authority_WRITTEN Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_8_Nosy_Default Why is this place made of Manacalon remnants?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_9_Kebra_NPC Urka very wise shaman.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_10_Kebra_NPC Reads books.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_11_Nosy_Default Orcs can read?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_12_Cynical_Default Amaaazing.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default What should we know about Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC Urka loves old elf stuff.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC Ask you to bring back some, for sure.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_16_Kebra_NPC But his tribe can fight, useful for facing Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC Kebra?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC I thought you were dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC Who are your nyark... friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_22_Urka_NPC Oh, Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_23_Authority_Default Urka, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_24_Urka_NPC Yes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_25_Authority_Default We need your tribe to support Brok's challenge against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_26_Urka_NPC Hmmm. First, bring me the key to the sunken city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default What's that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC But Arrok... he found it first.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_31_Urka_NPC Found his stone of power there.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC Now, no one can enter, unless...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC ...unless you go through the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC Find the Emperor's key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN It's a deal!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN Arrok is already in the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN The Emperor's key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN It must be very dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC Not more than facing Arrok without help.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default What is this key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC So find his tomb and bring me the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC Arrok only found a part of the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC The key will open many more rooms... to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default All right, we'll bring you the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default I think that's the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default Let's go find this key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default That's a change of mood.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default Fantastic! It's like travelling back in time, a thousand years!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default Well, it still stinks of sulfur.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default So, they really did rule the world.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default Maybe it's buried, like this city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default We know...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm, and sunk down here. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default I would have expected something bigger, fancier.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default Prince Kealin, firstborn.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default Cute.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default Show some respect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default Slavers, the whole lot of them.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC Who dares disturb the eternal rest of the Emperor Laethar?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY We got lost.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY We're clearing your city of orcs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY We go where we like.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01 This isn't your world any more - we can go wherever we like!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC Fool!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC Your souls will never leave this tomb!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02 You city is infested by orcs. We're here to clean it up.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC What are orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default Smart move!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03 We just got lost, sorry.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC Lies of a tomb robber!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04 We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC Then what do you mean?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC Monsters, you say? 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC Clearly you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default We call them orcs, they're like... dwarves, but worse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC Really?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC Then you are on a sacred mission.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC Monsters must not defile a city of Emperors.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC Leave this holy tomb and do what you must.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC There is minor gate by the tapestry of the Aer-Elai. Use it to reach the inner city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default Thank you, your Imperial Majesty.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default Did you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default The ghost? Yes, we did.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default The key! It's in the coffin.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default Oh, no!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default So what do we do?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default Wake him up again and ask nicely?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default Get ready for a fight.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC You again?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang Time to die for good, dead boy!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC Liars! Traitors!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default Urka!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC I must say, I am impressed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default You followed us?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC So you don't have bring the key back to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default You really want that key, don't you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC Make it easier to take that crown from you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC Urka? How? I know him since...child.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC But, all these orcs, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default The Soraks took over a whole world, back on Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC The Crown? It can stop them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default We think so - hope so.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC You need Arrok's stone, for real.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC Urka? Big mind like him?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC Maybe Arrok is gak, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC But Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC You choose a chief for them, and they follow you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default Also, Radulf will not come.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default We couldn't reach an agreement.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player What is that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player Can't we just kill the guards and go in?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC Door is magic. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC But Arrok will open, if challenged.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC We need the tribes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC Look!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default Is that...?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC Arrok! Alone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default That did the trick, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default What are these burned corpses everywhere?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default Well, looks like he did half the job for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC Do we need the tribes, now?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC Arrok still very powerful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC Sure. So we need to take him down fast.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC We can still backtrack and follow the plan.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default Uh huh.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC Ah, Kebra of Suncloud...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC ...you walk with nyarks? Shame on you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC Funny nyark. No, you, give me yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC Useless worms.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default What the...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default Brok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default Where are the guards?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC Surrendered.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default What?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default No big speech, then?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC No, but door still closed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default Do you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default The door?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default No, there is a... power.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default I think, though... with the Crown...we might be able to enter.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default Do we have a choice?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default There's always the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default Is that gem more powerful than the others?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default ...the gem must have been some sort of catalyst.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default That was close!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default What do you think happened to...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC ...our orc friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default You mean yours. They're no friends of mine.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default Burned dead... who cares?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default They seem more civilized than I expected.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default Next time we run into some, you can tell them that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default All right  let's get out of here. It's not safe!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default I've heard that before…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default …a couple of hundred times since we started…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default I so love manual labor! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default It's Maraike's will!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang Chop, don't talk!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default Come on, guys! It's just another hedge! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default Last bloody hedge I intend to cut through in my life time! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default Hard to believe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default Einar strike me if I lie!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_3_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default He isn't here, Two-Face - but Iam!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC This place will be your death, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default This place? How did you get here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default How did you come to this place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC We were sent by our chosen one! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC Blessed be his name.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default How did he locate the place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default Ever heard of the Inquisition ? Talk to us now!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC The chosen one worked some magic. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default This place is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default What curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then...
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC Because I know we will all die here! It said so! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default Disturbing claims! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default …but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default ... and not one single enemy body near them! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default And what do we do with our friend here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default And yet, we have laws! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default He's too dangerous! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default Servants of the gods!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default Protectors of Solasta!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default Those statues look weird!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default But are we entitled to it? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang What do you mean? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default And your point?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default That we would be stealing from the owner!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default Naah - spoils of war!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually.
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default Can we just take a peek first. We don't have to take anything. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default Oooops… Sorry? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default All right, but don't make me regret it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC And so the thieves come to meet their doom!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal There are no thieves here! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default …by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC ... if you had just looked! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default Had to make sure they weren't fake!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default We didn't even have a chance to put them back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC You stole! Otherwise there would have been no fight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC And there is only one punishment for theft!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC Death!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang This is my kind of fight!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder... 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default Wonder about what?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default Not to forget the how! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default Apparently the gem was split… to protect it, maybe? 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default That would explain the traps and monsters.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default It's one way to make sure this gem is safe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default But what does it mean?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default That another Master survived the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default Someone who doesn't like visitors. 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal What was that? Where are we? 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal You had to step on it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal My friend, we will have to think this through!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal And watch where you put your hands in the future.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal How was I supposed to know? 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal Perhaps if you thought before you acted?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal So I can die of old age and boredom…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal …while we wait for you to finish pondering all the...
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal ...theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_13_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal By brawn or brains, I don't care which!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal I just felt something!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal Like what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal Like the floor gave a little under my weight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_4_NosyOrElse_Formal Well, this tile does look a little different! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_5_NosyOrElse_Normal Spread out! Look for similar tiles!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_6_SelfishnessOrGreed_Normal What's in it for me? 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_7_NosyOrElse_Normal A way out! Unless you have a better idea?
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal It worked! The platform shifted!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_2_NosyOrElse_Normal True - but we're not out of this… labyrinth yet! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal True!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_4_NosyOrElse_Formal We've made progress, though! Let's keep going!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal Let's spread out and explore!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_6_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal Professional trap-finders first!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_7_RogueOrHighestPerception_Normal Did someone just call for my expertise? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal Interesting light, that. Very bright.
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_2_nosyOrElse_Normal Wonder what it's about?
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal Only one way to find out! Come on!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_4_Arcana_DC20_Failure_Normal Looks like a will-o'-wisp to me! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_5_Arcana_DC20_Success_Normal How fascinating! A new wonder to behold! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_6_RogueOrElse_Normal Not so fast! There were enough traps till now to…
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_7_RogueOrElse_Normal ...make me really nervous!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_8_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal You and me both, my friend! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_9_Crownbearer_Normal Let's tread carefully then! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_10_RogueOrAcolyte_Normal Today is Misaye's birthday! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_11_ClericOrWorshipMaraike_Normal Maraike's will be done! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_12_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal Next time, pray harder for a miracle! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_1_HighestPerception_Slang Einar's sword! What a sight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_2_NosyOrHistoryOrElse_Formal Unbelievable!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_3_HistoryDC15_Success_Formal A classical Manacalon manor! What a wonderful sight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_4_HistoryDC15_Failure_Formal What a weird old building!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_5_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal Guys, I move two steps back and well… it's gone!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_6_HighestPerception_Normal What is gone? 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_7_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal This manor! Something weird is going on!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_8_HighestPerception_Normal Story of my life!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_9_CynicOrElse_Normal Weird gets us money and fame! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_10_AcolytOrElse_Normal Do you really have to be so… greedy?
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_11_CynicOrElse_Normal Not greedy, practical! We do things…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_12_CynicOrElse_Normal …that no one in their right minds would attempt…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_13_CynicOrElse_Normal …and we don't do it for nothing!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_14_HelpfulnessOrFriendliness_Normal Speak for yourself! A good deed is a good deed!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_15_CynicOrElse_Normal Then let's get in there and see what kind of weirdness we find!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_1_Butler_NPC Good day to you.  I am Gerard, the butler.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_1_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC I see you have purloined some of my master's property…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_2_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC …might I suggest you put those trinkets back to where they belong? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_1_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC Welcome.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_2_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC Please come with me.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_3_CrownbearerOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal Clear skies to you! Where are you taking us?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC To the master, of course! 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal And who would that be? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_6_Butler_NPC That is for not for me to say. All will be made plain in good time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC …please don't abuse it.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal We are grateful for your hospitality.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Hospitality? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC We have not seen guests of your... quality for some time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Some time? How long, exactly? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Do you remember some… prominent guest? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15a_Butler_NPC You were there, Master Kaisenax!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16a_Crownbearer_Normal Me? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17a_Butler_NPC I remember it distinctly. Though your form was somewhat different.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal We would never dream of abusing your hospitality!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Someine abused your hospitality in the past?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC Yes, believe it or not, some…creatures can be…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC ...insufferably rude!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal True nobility is reflected in the character!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC ...that you would be capable of such discourtesy.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal …might I ask what would be considered rude here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_18b_Cynic_Slang So, don't piss in the potted plants, then? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal Really? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC Well met strangers!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC Ah, my little thieving visitors.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal Clear skies to you, master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal Your plight? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC It must have been a thousand years…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC I am… 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC How weird, I can't recall my name…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC Call me master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal Master of Conjuration!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC Yes, the Master of Conjuration! Exactly! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal Greetings, old friend!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal What do you call him that?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal The crown…told me so.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC Ah, the crown…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC …thank you for coming to my rescue, 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC The vanishing of mana left me broken.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal Mana was gone ? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC Of course, after the closing of the rift!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC That's why I and by siblings were killed or crippled.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC Kaisenax, and us, the masters, along with these deities…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC …we poured everything we had to close and seal that rift! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal So the Cataclysm is…your fault? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC It was the price to pay to stop the threat.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal And so you took a gamble? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC We were born to rule, not to grovel!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC And we had sworn to protect our people! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal You mean your slaves?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC But your empire was destroyed.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal Who knows how many elves were killed?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC Enough about the past! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC Now I get that you want my gem.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC But even with his crown, you're not my Magister!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC So if you want it…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC …you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_07 Kill them!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_08 Intruders!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_09 Don't let them get away!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_10 They're crazy!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_11 They'll kill us if we don't fight back!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_12 I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_13 Found one!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_14 Eh… nothing. Very funny.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_15 Another one, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default Alright, I'm opening it.
Narration/&Banter_SwitchToCautious We should be careful.
Narration/&PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default Balance and harmony, chaplain!
Narration/&PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC Fair weather, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC Good luck and fair weather!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01 Charming little town…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02 Access to the canyon is blocked!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03 You can't get to the other side - move on!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04 You are not allowed to cross this bridge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01 Careful - I heard something!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02 What were these goblins doing here?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03 There must be some reason.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04 Look - it works!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05 It's something, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06 This is where they're coming from.
Narration/&Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye Just passing by.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_DalonLark01 Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HalmanSummer01 Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HeddlonSurespell01 Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_JorielFoxeye01 Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_03 Safe travels, adventurers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_03 Watch yourselves outside - the roads are not safe!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default Wait… Lisbath stayed back?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default She was broken.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default They're gonna kill her!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default If we go back for her, we die, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default But… Fine… you're probably right.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01 There's something strange about this place.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02 I feel like someone's watching us.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03 Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04 It's too quiet!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05 This is huge!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06 Did you see that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07 A Defiler. It vanished!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08 We should be careful. We're not alone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01 Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01 I can see something in the water.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02 There's something under the ground.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01 Friends are always welcome at the Shield!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02 Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_03 These walls seem to have been reinforced recently.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_04 Lore text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_05 Lore Text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_06 That elf looks so military in that garb, and those symbols on the tabard! It can only be Empress Cylloriel Wildspirit!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_07 Lore about the hall
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_01 It doesn't do anything. Maybe we're missing something.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_02 We've dealt with this before.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03 We should come back at the night.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09 A spectacular place, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10 Are they… ghosts?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11 What other wonders does this place contain?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12 Let's stay on guard.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_02 We're close now, I can feel it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_A This magic goes far beyond our knowledge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_B We can't go through here. It's too dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09 Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10 This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn’t aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11 Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don’t have enough mana to make it work!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07 It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08 This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_09 Maybe this only works at night!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_19_Nope_Formal We'll see what we can do.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Nope_WRITTEN We can't promise anything.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Sure_WRITTEN Sure, we'll do it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13 What is that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_14 Sorry for the inconvenience.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_12 Laboratory. ENTRY STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_13 Library
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_14 Salon
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_03 These projections are from the master, not ghosts.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_36_SellswordOrElse_Default It was too late for him.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_ PuzzleLight_Broken This symbol is illegible. Perhaps we can find another one elsewhere?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_15 The… projections, they're all gone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_16 This must have something to do with Adrasteia's awakening.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_4_Healer_Any_Normal She doesn't have any wounds that I can see!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_5_SarcasmOrElse_Normal Well then, dazzle us and find out what's happening to her!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_15 By all the gods! Manacalon orchids! Clearly, they are correctly named!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_16 "Principles of Architecture", by Karhelas Grayhand! He designed the Teansolais, the imperial palace of Siothyrnas!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_17 This is… Eiradir Fairmind, the justicar, as he presents the first codex of imperial law to the Court!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_01 Wait? Have you ever seen this kind of plant?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_02 The gem must be in this forest. One last effort and it will be ours.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_03 I knew it, we shouldn’t have touched that sticky equipment.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_3_Arbal_NPC Who your nyark friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_4_Arbal_NPC Eh, nyark speaks! Kebra teach them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_10_Arbal_NPC Before Arrok, Arbal would kill nyarks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_13_Arbal_NPC Not nice, no.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_15_Orcishspeaker_Default Ah! Thank you, nyark - that make my day.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_04 It's too thick, we won't make it like this!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_01 What was that? Where are we?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_00 Go back to where you came from, you insignificant beings. You are not worthy to enter.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_01 I laugh at the emptiness of your actions.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_02 Play the wise, you fools. Go ahead.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_1 Let's stay together. We can't see anything in those caves.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_2 Do you remember where we come from?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Greed_1 It's too easy… 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01 The gem, we found it!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02 Where are the Soraks?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1 The gold just disappears in my hands!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01 Edrof says gate closed for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_02 Bloodspear tribe is strong!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_03 Nyark go talk to Edrof. Only he give order to open passage.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_04 Brok strong chief! He defeated Edrof.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_01 Kebra survived! Kebra strong.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_02 Nyark want to trade?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_03 Bloodspear strong tribe! Bloodspear plenty.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_04 Nyarks friend with Brok. Brok strong chief!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_01 Nyarks go see Radulf!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_02 Radulf great Shaman.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_03 Nyark got mighty axe?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_04 Nyarks have spider webs in hair.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_01 Brok new chief? Brok not dead?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_02 Nyarks need food?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_03 Bladefang best tribe. Bladefang got big shaman!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04 Kebra friend with nyarks?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01 Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02 This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03 No greataxe means we are not joining you.
Narration/&Tavern_02_41_Player_Default Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_02_42_Player_Default Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…
Narration/&Tavern_02_43_Merton You think I don't know the difference?
Narration/&Tavern_02_44_Merton All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!
Narration/&Tavern_02_45_Merton Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!
Narration/&Tavern_02_46_Player_Default No one believes in Soraks anymore.
Narration/&Tavern_02_47_Player_Default Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them.
Narration/&Tavern_02_48_Player_Default Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith.
Narration/&Tavern_02_49_Merton Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…
Narration/&Tavern_02_50_Merton …anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know.
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Player_Default Oh, come on!
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Merton You'll see.
Narration/&Tavern_02_52_Player_Default Anyway…
Narration/&Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings.
Narration/&Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…
Narration/&Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze …in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!
Narration/&Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them.
Narration/&Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed.
Narration/&Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction.
Narration/&Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01 Yes… I understand.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02 Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03 Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04 We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05 What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06 It's gotta be cursed! 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_07 We're supposed to share the loot, by the way.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08 Forget it, let's get out of here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default Are they all undead in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Default Undead? What other abominations are in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Default Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Default Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Default Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Player Stay in the light! It is our only protection.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Player Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default And certainly not lizardfolk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21b_Player So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21c_Player Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21d_Player Was he one of them all along, do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default Doesn't have the big spines…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default Stop losing time, it's just a statue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01 Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02 It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03 Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04 I see the point of the Scavengers now…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05 Why not keep this to ourselves?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01 Crap! The book just turned into dust!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02 Damn! This book is… not really here!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03 Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04 The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05 I should have known… it was too good to be true.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default I can't remember much more.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default "A" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. "Sorr-Akkath" means "beloved of Sorr-Tarr" in their tongue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default I've heard whispers of cultists with an "A" tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default There's a name, too: "Arivad."
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default We better be careful.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak.
Narration/&InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality.
Narration/&InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance.
Narration/&InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC Did you find anything else that could help us track them?
Narration/&InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC There was a parchment. 
Narration/&InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC If you find it, send for the Tshar.
Narration/&InTemple_7_Curious_NPC You can read that?
Narration/&InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue.
Narration/&InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC I knew it!
Narration/&InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC It means "general."
Narration/&InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC You were wise to run.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default …they all had this tattoo on their arm.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default And we found this letter.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC It is indeed one of their ways. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Now this, is the A of Arivad.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default Can you enlighten us?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Of course.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC We, paladins and clerics of Einar, are the guardians of these memories.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC At the site of the rift, thousands of Sorak tried to cross.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Sorr-Tarr himself tried.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC I supposed that's another one of their tricks.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC …it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC So that, if one day, they were to return.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC We'd be ready.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC I'm sorry to say, after a thousands years, only few of us remain.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC But you brought us proof.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The Soraks are not extinct.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO Are there different Soraks?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default We fought different ones, do you know more?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Some of their are deadly assassins, invisible, venomous.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Others are giant brutes.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC The Shikkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO Can they mimic people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default Can they really impersonate people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC It's been proven, though it's a long process.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC Upon death, they would return to their original form.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO Why do people follow them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default How do they get people to worship them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC They get into people's minds…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC …learn their darkest secrets, they fears, their shameful desires.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple.
Narration/&InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded.
Narration/&InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again.
Narration/&Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC Deputies!
Narration/&Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?
Narration/&Council02_Final3_Any_Default Yes, madam.
Narration/&Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?
Narration/&Council02_Final5_Any_Default Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch.
Narration/&Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?
Narration/&Council02_Final7_Any_Default It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely.
Narration/&Council02_Final8_Any_Default And it may not be totally safe.
Narration/&Council02_Final9_Any_Default Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose.
Narration/&Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service.
Narration/&Council02_Final11_Any_Default You're welcome.
Narration/&Council02_Final12_Any_Formal Chancellor.
Narration/&Exposition1_Beric_NPC Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens.
Narration/&Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC We should deputize them right away.
Narration/&Exposition3_Beric_NPC They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return.
Narration/&Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?
Narration/&Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already.
Narration/&Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter.
Narration/&Exposition7_Beric_NPC Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war.
Narration/&Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!
Narration/&Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!
Narration/&Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!
Narration/&Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!
Narration/&Exposition12_Beric_NPC I know. The Council must hold.
Narration/&Exposition13_Beric_NPC Let's get our new deputies to work.
Narration/&CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_2_Player_Default Again?
Narration/&CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC Well, I'm here at your service, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A Ask for details about the geography.
Narration/&CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1 Ask for details about the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2 Ask for details about the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3 Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B Ask for details about the politics.
Narration/&CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1 Ask for details about the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2 Ask for details about the factions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3 Ask for details about the Scavengers.
Narration/&CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics Change the general topic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_13_Player_Default Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?
Narration/&CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC Really? Right.
Narration/&CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC The Council was founded to ease tensions among the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…
Narration/&CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC …to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade.
Narration/&CarranTalk_19_Player_Default Why are you recruiting adventurers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…
Narration/&CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC …and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything.
Narration/&CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it.
Narration/&CarranTalk_23_Carran_NPC We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation.
Narration/&CarranTalk_24_Carran_NPC It's a… fresh idea. I'm afraid it hasn't had much success so far.
Narration/&CarranTalk_25_Carran_NPC Captain Merran is a great example for beginners.
Narration/&CarranTalk_26_Carran_NPC But the events in Caer Lem… well, we lost almost all of our people there.
Narration/&CarranTalk_27_Carran_NPC Captain Henrik's demise sends the wrong message.
Narration/&CarranTalk_28_Carran_NPC Lord Stonebeard, an influential member of the Snow Alliance is also very…
Narration/&CarranTalk_29_Carran_NPC …doubtful about the whole concept.
Narration/&CarranTalk_30_Carran_NPC I thought you knew, since you're in it…
Narration/&CarranTalk_31_Player_Default What can you tell us about the Scavengers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_32_Carran_NPC I would say: don't be fooled by the name.
Narration/&CarranTalk_33_Carran_NPC Some of them were already exploring the Old Empire before the Copperhead Road…
Narration/&CarranTalk_34_Carran_NPC …when it was near impossible to get through the mountains and into the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_35_Carran_NPC Most of them are now providing services to adventurers, and the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_36_Carran_NPC I supposed you've already met Annie Bagmordah, her leader.
Narration/&CarranTalk_37_Carran_NPC What factions are in play here?
Narration/&CarranTalk_38_Carran_NPC The Circle of Danantar is based here in the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_39_Carran_NPC His leader, Lord Edvan Danantar, is a renowned Spellblade master.
Narration/&CarranTalk_40_Carran_NPC The Guild of Antiquarians is from the Snow Alliance, to the north.
Narration/&CarranTalk_41_Carran_NPC They crave anything of historical value, even mundane items…
Narration/&CarranTalk_42_Carran_NPC …as long as they're old enough.
Narration/&CarranTalk_43_Carran_NPC The Tower of Knowledge is from the Kingdom of Gallivan…
Narration/&CarranTalk_44_Carran_NPC …they are academics, interested in all kinds of… well, knowledge.
Narration/&CarranTalk_45_Carran_NPC The Arcaneum is from the New Empire…
Narration/&CarranTalk_46_Carran_NPC …magic is their passion, especially ancient, Manacalon magic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_47_Carran_NPC You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_48_Carran_NPC And… stay in the light.
Narration/&CarranTalk_49_Carran_NPC I'll be here to answer your questions…
Narration/&CarranTalk_50_Carran_NPC …unless I'm busy with Council affairs.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_01 Where are we landing this time? 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_02 The lake shouldn't be dried up with such a flow coming from the river.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_02 What do you think? Fight or leave?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal You had to touch it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC …magic came out of nowhere! Targeting us! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default And how is that a curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC After each death, it… it said it again!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default Freeze, Soraks! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_2_Sellsword_Slang Time to show them who we are! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default They haven't seen us yet! No need to rush!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_4_Sellsword_Slang It comes to the same thing in the end!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default Look - they've gone into that shed! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_6_SpyOrHighestperception_Default It's pretty small for so many Soraks. Tunnel entrance?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_NotHighestInt_Default No reason to wait, they're gone.
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_9_HighestWisorElse_Default What if they come out?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default We'll kill them.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight1_Starter_Default What just happened?!
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight2_Cynical_Default A gem…right?
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight3_Cynical_Default Just like that.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight4_Selfpres_Default Did you hear that? 
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight5_Sellsword_Default The sound of killing.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight6_Starter_Default The soraks.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight7_Selfpres_Default That was fast.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight8_Sellsword_Default You afraid?
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight9_Selfpres_Default Of course not.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_TheBeast_02 A comfortable golden mattress
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_TheSuperEgo_03 Another one of these platforms!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_01 All these movements make me dizzy
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_02 Be careful, it may be dangerous
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_03 What is the tormented mind that built this place?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_04 Have we been killed and sent to the afterlife? I don't know what to think.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_05 Rotate, again and again.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_A_1 Just open the door!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_A_2 I promise I will be good! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_B_1 You can't leave! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_B_2 None of us can leave!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_1 The Master sees all!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_2 Don't do it! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_if_Stolen_1 Fools! The redeemers won't stay hungry long!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_if_Stolen_2 Pray for mercy! But don't expect it! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Help_1 So tired, so hungry, and the day is still young!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Help_2 Thank you, kind stranger!
