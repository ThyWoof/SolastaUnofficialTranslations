Narration/&NecromancyTextObj23	A strange-looking symbol, probably mystical.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj24	A rune or glyph of some unknown type.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj25	A mystical symbol, possibly inactive.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj26	What's wrong with all these mirrors?
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj27	A very odd painting.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_01	The bridge is closed for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_02	The Council is in the opposite direction.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_01	There's trouble on the road. Please remain in town for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_02	Please stay in the high town for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MaddyGreenisle01	Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah01	We'll talk after your swearing-in.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah02	I'll be with you in a minute.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer01	Let's get you deputized, first, shall we?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer02	I'm in the middle of something - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot01	Lord Carran said not to bother you… yet.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot02	Come back later. I'm busy with the accounts.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_KarelMartel	Lord Carran said no more beer… sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark01	I'm busy. Come back later.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark02	Oh, it's you. Well, I'm still busy. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark03	Look who's here - Caer Cyflen's rising stars!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark04	Council business is not my business. Be on your way.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark05	We knew this war was looming. We'll prevail, as always.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton01	Go get killed in the Badlands…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton02	You were still filling your diapers when I killed my first ghoul…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton03	I heard your stories. Not impressive.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton04	I know everyone in this city… and everyone knows me.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton05	You're still here? I'm sure there are some rats to kill in some cave somewhere.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton06	I know that look. Something happened… something bad.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton07	Don't get too cocky. These Soraks have more tricks up their sleeves.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton08	That crown's a trouble magnet, I can tell.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton09	Still alive? Good. There's more cleaning up to do.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton10	I'm better, sure. Doesn't mean I can't have a couple of beers…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton11	Well, I handled some unfinished business… feels good. I'm celebrating.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton12	If you're looking for a sharp blade… I'm your man.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton13	Any time, friends… I mean, any time after I finish this beer.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant01	I'm busy. Go see Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant02	We're packing - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant03	You want to buy something, ask Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant04	No time to chat - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard01	Keep out, strangers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard02	The Baron's waiting for you.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaptainIronshell01	Stay in the light, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyPCSpeech_TowerOfMagicJammedDoor	This door is blocked… magically?
Narration/&Banter_Generic_01	Something's off.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_02	We should search the area carefully.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_03	Look at this place!
Narration/&Banter_Generic_04	Doesn't make any sense…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_01	Where did those goblins come from?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_02	Some hole in the mountain, I guess.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_03	What's that smell?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_04	Damn, it stinks…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_05	I wouldn't sleep here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_06	The Soraks can't be far away.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_07	We need to rest if we want to stand a chance against them.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_08	This place is so dark…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_09	That was fun.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_10	That was a long shot.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_11	We were so close.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_01	I can't believe Lisbath stayed behind…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_02	We're all gonna die…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_03	I'll have to tell the captain's wife.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_01	We should have left long ago…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_02	Leadership is what we need now.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_03	They won't get me without a fight.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_01	Up to my knees in the mud, nothing new here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_02	Shit food, shit shoes, business as usual.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_03	If we survive this I might drink myself to death.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_01	This place doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_02	In the Badlands… blah, blah…
Narration/&Banter_ToM_03	What happens if you fall down there?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_04	Wanna try?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_05	All these books floating around and I can't grab them.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_06	Are those webs?
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_01	Welcome, deputies!
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_02	Your rooms are ready.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_03	Good day, senior deputies.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_04	Clear skies… as they say!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_01	This place is so… wet.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_02	Feels like everything's dead around here…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_03	Well, it's dark, but at least it's not sewers anymore.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_04	Stay on your guard! We weren't invited here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_05	What's in all those bottles?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_06	I wouldn't set them on fire just to find out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_07	Smells like death.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_08	Is that a… pile of corpses? Gross!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_09	Someone here doesn't like the light of day.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_10	What kind of castle is that?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_11	Someone transformed it into a maze.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_12	Someone paranoid, you mean?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_13	We're going to die here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_14	There must a way be out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_15	Look for hints!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_16	It lost its mana, that's all.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_17	These arrows, they're not just random.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_18	Something's changed here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_19	That cannot be opened from here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_20	There must be a mechanism somewhere.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_21	I heard a mechanism.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_22	That opened something.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_23	This guy made it this far… maybe he found a hint.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_24	Another victim of the maze…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_25	Tell me we're not going back in there…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_26	So, no rune activated on that teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_27	I guess we need to reset the teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_28	I think we took a wrong turn.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_29	Hmm… four slabs for the four of us?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_30	And… no rune on that teleporter, either.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_31	I think this slab has triggered something!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_32	I heard some kind of mechanism!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Talbut	Keep away from my home, strangers!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Anbgi	Where's that damn femur?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_01	She's crazy…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_02	Shouldn't we go to Coparann?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_01	My beautiful river… broken and stained…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_02	The pull, the pull…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_03	Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_04	Are there dwarf kings now? Halfling kings too, maybe?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_05	That sounds… wrong.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_06	No slaves, no Gates…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_07	…this travel is exhausting.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_08	Humans don't look that bad.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_09	They smell a bit, though…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_10	This… town is really dirty.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_11	Is this Baron really a dwarf?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_12	I can't call a dwarf my lord, can I?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_13	He's rude. But he is a dwarf, after all.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_14	He is a nice dwarf.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_15	A halfling merchant? I almost didn't see him.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_01	Nice gardens.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_02	This place is magnificent.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_03	I never thought I'd get so close to the embassies.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_04	That's a view!
Narration/&LoreTrailer01	Before the Cataclysm, there were no gods on Solasta.
Narration/&LoreTrailer02	No humans, either.
Narration/&LoreTrailer03	Then the Rift opened.
Narration/&LoreTrailer04	Some say it was a magical accident… 
Narration/&LoreTrailer05	…or the work of an evil god.
Narration/&LoreTrailer06	No one knows for sure.
Narration/&LoreTrailer07	The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire
Narration/&LoreTrailer08	- Manacalon, they called it -
Narration/&LoreTrailer09	and twisted the land beyond recognition.
Narration/&LoreTrailer10	Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures.
Narration/&LoreTrailer11	But something is happening, deep in those Badlands.
Narration/&LoreTrailer12	Whatever it is,
Narration/&LoreTrailer13	it can't be good.
Narration/&TelemaArrivingTitle	Entering Telema
Narration/&Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter	So, these are the ruins of Telema?
Narration/&Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard	Just as the chronicles describe them!
Narration/&Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard	Imagine the wonders that await us inside!
Narration/&Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric	Don't forget… we're here to help the Scavengers.
Narration/&Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue	And get rich, right?
Narration/&Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue	Help the Scavengers and get rich.
Narration/&Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter	You're all heart, aren't you?
Narration/&Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric	That must be their camp over there.
Narration/&Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric	Come on, let's go.
Narration/&TelemaMeetingScavsTitle	The Scavengers' Camp
Narration/&Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena	Who goes there?
Narration/&Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Friends!
Narration/&Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Runnel sent us.
Narration/&Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek	Where is he?
Narration/&Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Resting… he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay.
Narration/&Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric	He said you need help.
Narration/&Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek	We did. If only you'd come sooner…
Narration/&Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice	What happened?
Narration/&Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer	We came as soon as we could. What happened?
Narration/&Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena	We know… and thanks.
Narration/&Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena	Dek here is upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek	I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena	He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek	Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek	Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice	We're here now.
Narration/&Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer	Well, we're here now. How can we help?
Narration/&Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena	Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena	He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek	I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena	He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek	Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek	Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice	We could go back.
Narration/&Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer	Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back.
Narration/&Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek	Yes, well, maybe you should!
Narration/&Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena	Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena	He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek	Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!
Narration/&Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena	We can't leave Hector in there.
Narration/&Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek	He's dead, Lena… dead! It's too late!
Narration/&Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena	You don't know that!
Narration/&Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice	Calm down.
Narration/&Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer	Calm down, now. This won't help.
Narration/&Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice	We'll help you.
Narration/&Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer	It's all right… we're here to help you.
Narration/&Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice	Amazing.
Narration/&Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer	Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs the trouble?
Narration/&Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue	What's our help worth to you, anyway?
Narration/&Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Stop it!
Narration/&Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena	All right.
Narration/&Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena	What did Runnel tell you?
Narration/&Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Just that his team needed help… nothing else.
Narration/&Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena	We were scavenging in the ruins, and -
Narration/&Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek	Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!
Narration/&Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena	It was just a raiding party.
Narration/&Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena	We fought them off… 
Narration/&Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena	…but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off.
Narration/&Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek	And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job.
Narration/&Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter	They haven't done that yet, though.
Narration/&Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Well, you're right about your friend… 
Narration/&Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue	…he must be dead by now.
Narration/&Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric	We don't know that. There is always hope.
Narration/&Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night.
Narration/&Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard	I don't know… they took him alive, after all…
Narration/&Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue	So they wanted to keep him fresh… orcs are orcs!
Narration/&Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?
Narration/&Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek	Yeah… good luck with that!
Narration/&Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Why is he so angry?
Narration/&Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena	He and Hector don't exactly get along.
Narration/&Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena	But he's one of our crew… 
Narration/&Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena	…and I won't leave anyone behind.
Narration/&Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric	We gave our word to your leaders.
Narration/&Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric	We will get Hector back.
Narration/&Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena	Thanks.
Narration/&Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena	Do you need food?
Narration/&Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter	You think we'll be away for that long?
Narration/&Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena	You can never be too careful… 
Narration/&Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena	…that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena	We can spare some if you need it.
Narration/&Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena	We have more than we need for just the two of us.
Narration/&Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek	Are you serious?
Narration/&Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek	You're giving away our food?
Narration/&Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena	They're risking their lives for us, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek	For Hector. We can starve, apparently.
Narration/&Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate	The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate	The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Get it?
Narration/&Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	I don't believe it.
Narration/&Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	That's on you, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	Don't worry,
Narration/&Telema_91_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	that's just the way he is.
Narration/&Telema_92_MeetingScavs_Clericchecksuccess	Thanks, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_93_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	No.
Narration/&Telema_94_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	Nice try.
Narration/&Telema_95_MeetingScavs_Fightercheckfailed	Shut up.
Narration/&Telema_96_MeetingScavs_Fighter	We should get moving and find your friend.
Narration/&Telema_97_MeetingScavs_Lena	Thanks!
Narration/&Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena	And good luck!
Narration/&Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion	You're right… keep your food.
Narration/&Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion	You're right… keep it. We'll survive.
Narration/&Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric	We'll be back in no time.
Narration/&Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric	If not, you'll have enough to eat.
Narration/&Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Don't look at me.
Narration/&Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	Just one day of food, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	All right, take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Thank you!
Narration/&Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	Absolutely.
Narration/&Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice	Your boss said you'd feed us.
Narration/&Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer	Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed.
Narration/&Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek	Did he?
Narration/&Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Are you calling me a liar?
Narration/&Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	No.
Narration/&Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess	So?
Narration/&Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	So take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	Why not?
Narration/&Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	Fair enough.
Narration/&Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed	Impressive negotiation skills.
Narration/&Telema_118_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	He's stubborn, that's all.
Narration/&TelemaBasReliefTitle	A Sight for Sore Eyes
Narration/&Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Perfectly preserved!
Narration/&Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	What is it?
Narration/&Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces.
Narration/&Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times.
Narration/&Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!
Narration/&Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	The Old Empire was built on slavery and racism.
Narration/&Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson.
Narration/&Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Now… does this look valuable to you?
Narration/&Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	All history is valuable, my friend.
Narration/&Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Tell that to my purse.
Narration/&Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter	Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out.
Narration/&TelemaChestTitle	Too Good to Be True
Narration/&Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter	Well, that's interesting.
Narration/&Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue	You don't say! Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter	I'd be careful if I were you.
Narration/&Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter	It looks too good to be true.
Narration/&Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue	That's right. You can't be too careful… 
Narration/&Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue	…that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&TelemaStatueTitle	Memory of the Past
Narration/&Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Try not to stare… you're making that statue uncomfortable.
Narration/&Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard	But it's… can you read this?
Narration/&Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin… I mean, education.
Narration/&Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric	That's Emperor Gildean the Third.
Narration/&Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue	How do you know?
Narration/&Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric	It's written here.
Narration/&Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric	For those who can read it.
Narration/&Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue	That's nice for you, I'm sure.
Narration/&Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard	His was a very ancient dynasty.
Narration/&Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Look at his date of birth.
Narration/&Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric	And location.
Narration/&Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Wait! I must copy this.
Narration/&Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard	The Tower will find this interesting.
Narration/&Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter	Are you done?
Narration/&TelemaDoorTitle	Dead End?
Narration/&Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue	Can we open it?
Narration/&Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter	I don't see how.
Narration/&Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard	Must be magically sealed.
Narration/&Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric	Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?
Narration/&Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter	In the Badlands, anything's possible.
Narration/&Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue	Do you have a spell to open it?
Narration/&Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard	No.
Narration/&Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter	Let's not waste time, then. Move out!
Narration/&Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue	They must have gone through here after they took Hector.
Narration/&Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric	Really? We need to crawl through there?
Narration/&Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue	Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?
Narration/&Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric	Very funny.
Narration/&Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter	I see light ahead!
Narration/&Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue	Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor.
Narration/&Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter	Be careful!
Narration/&Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue	Law of the Badlands, my friend.
Narration/&TelemaBackFromReconTitle	Meeting the Locals
Narration/&Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	The orcs are here.
Narration/&Telema_169_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Looks like we can sneak around.
Narration/&Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter	Even me?
Narration/&Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Ehh… probably.
Narration/&Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric	Did you see Hector?
Narration/&Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Not a trace.
Narration/&Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter	We should attack… we have the element of surprise.
Narration/&Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric	But what if Hector's down there too?
Narration/&Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard	I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with.
Narration/&Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Not these orcs.
Narration/&TelemaOrcCampExitTitle	Disappointment…
Narration/&Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter	So, no Hector?
Narration/&Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard	It doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric	Maybe he's farther down.
Narration/&Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter	All right, let's keep looking.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle	Lighting the Darkness
Narration/&Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter	I don't like this.
Narration/&Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue	We can climb down.
Narration/&Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	It's too dark.
Narration/&Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric	Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute.
Narration/&Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling.
Narration/&Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	Maybe we can use it to light up the place.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalExitTitle	No Way Back
Narration/&Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue	Damn it! Now we're stuck!
Narration/&Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter	Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?
Narration/&Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard	Not the orcs, no… 
Narration/&Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard	…but something else… maybe.
Narration/&Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter	We've come this far… let's find him.
Narration/&Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue	I'm starting to think we might need that food after all.
Narration/&TelemaShaftEntranceTitle	Unexpected Denizens
Narration/&Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric	What is this… an amphitheater?
Narration/&Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	A very special one.
Narration/&Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue	Not room for much of a crowd…
Narration/&Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here.
Narration/&Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Do spiders like magic shows?
Narration/&Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Because I see a lot of webs.
Narration/&Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Deep spiders. We will have to be careful.
Narration/&Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Deep Spiders?
Narration/&Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric	Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light.
Narration/&Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue	Just how large is very large?
Narration/&Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Just keep your lights ready…
Narration/&Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	…and your oil handy.
Narration/&Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face.
Narration/&Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up.
Narration/&TelemaShaftUpperTitle	A Way Out?
Narration/&Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter	How many are there?
Narration/&Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue	You don't want to know.
Narration/&Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric	Try pushing this down!
Narration/&Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric	I feel a weakness here.
Narration/&TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle	Escape… to Hector!
Narration/&Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard	Well done!
Narration/&Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue	You sure they're dead?
Narration/&Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter	Well, they're not coming back.
Narration/&Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue	Good.
Narration/&Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric	My friends, I believe I have found Hector.
Narration/&Telema_217_Rescue_Hector	By all the gods at once… thank you!
Narration/&Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter	Are you Hector?
Narration/&Telema_219_Rescue_Hector	Yes! And you?
Narration/&Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter	The boss sent us. Runnel went for help.
Narration/&Telema_221_Rescue_Hector	Runnel! So he survived?
Narration/&Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric	Barely, but yes.
Narration/&Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric	He's safely back in town.
Narration/&Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue	So, did the spiders take you?
Narration/&Telema_225_Rescue_Hector	The orcs did, after their raid.
Narration/&Telema_226_Rescue_Hector	They kept me for a while.
Narration/&Telema_227_Rescue_Hector	I was wondering why.
Narration/&Telema_228_Rescue_Hector	I finally got the answer when they… 
Narration/&Telema_229_Rescue_Hector	…well, they sacrificed me.
Narration/&Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter	What?
Narration/&Telema_231_Rescue_Hector	They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves.
Narration/&Telema_232_Rescue_Hector	They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater.
Narration/&Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue	Oh, that one?
Narration/&Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue	We kind of… destroyed it.
Narration/&Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter	The spider nest, too.
Narration/&Telema_236_Rescue_Hector	Interesting.
Narration/&Telema_237_Rescue_Hector	I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that.
Narration/&Telema_238_Rescue_Hector	This spider cult seemed important to them.
Narration/&Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter	Can't say I feel sorry for them.
Narration/&Telema_240_Rescue_Hector	I owe you my life. Thanks again.
Narration/&Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric	You are most welcome.
Narration/&Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter	You should rest, and I think we should do the same.
Narration/&Telema_243_Rescue_Hector	Good idea.
Narration/&Telema_244_Rescue_Choice	What's your story?
Narration/&Telema_245_Rescue_Answer	So Hector, what's your story?
Narration/&Telema_246_Rescue_Hector	Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really.
Narration/&Telema_247_Rescue_Hector	I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_248_Rescue_Choice	What about Lena and Dek?
Narration/&Telema_249_Rescue_Answer	Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!
Narration/&Telema_250_Rescue_Hector	Oh, those two… always fighting over something.
Narration/&Telema_251_Rescue_Hector	But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to.
Narration/&Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter	They seemed pretty much at each other's throats.
Narration/&Telema_253_Rescue_Hector	Yeah, like I said… always fighting.
Narration/&Telema_254_Rescue_Hector	But in battle, always back to back.
Narration/&Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue	Aww… that's so sweet.
Narration/&Telema_256_Rescue_Choice	Did you find anything good in here?
Narration/&Telema_257_Rescue_Answer	Did you find anything good in the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_258_Rescue_Hector	No, not much. You've seen the state of the place… 
Narration/&Telema_259_Rescue_Hector	…but there was something.
Narration/&Telema_260_Rescue_Hector	Didn't have time to use it.
Narration/&Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter	What is it?
Narration/&Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue	A key?
Narration/&Telema_263_Rescue_Hector	I think it opens the door in the ruins.
Narration/&Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue	Oh, yeah… that door.
Narration/&Telema_265_Rescue_Hector	At least, I hope it does.
Narration/&Telema_266_Rescue_Hector	Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all.
Narration/&Telema_267_Rescue_Choice	You're a cleric of Einar?
Narration/&Telema_268_Rescue_Answer	You're wearing the flaming sword.
Narration/&Telema_269_Rescue_Hector	And I can see you're from the Order of the Beacon.
Narration/&Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric	Are you a priest, Hector?
Narration/&Telema_271_Rescue_Hector	Just a humble follower.
Narration/&Telema_272_Rescue_Hector	This was given to me by one of your brothers.
Narration/&Telema_273_Rescue_Hector	We fought together… he felt like he owed me.
Narration/&Telema_274_Rescue_Hector	And he gave me this.
Narration/&Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter	I think we're all ready to go.
Narration/&Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard	Indeed.
Narration/&Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric	I think we're close to the surface.
Narration/&Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric	I can feel it.
Narration/&Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter	All right… let's move.
Narration/&Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter	Orcs! Over there!
Narration/&Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue	It's an ambush!
Narration/&Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter	Time to fight!
Narration/&Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter	Hey! Take a look at this.
Narration/&Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric	The stone is carved.
Narration/&Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter	Are we back near the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric	It looks fragile, let's try pushing it.
Narration/&Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter	Well done… we're back in the ruins!
Narration/&Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue	So, do you still have that key?
Narration/&Telema_289_WayBack_Hector	Sure.
Narration/&Telema_290_WayBack_Hector	Take it.
Narration/&Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard	Amazing!
Narration/&Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard	This room hasn't been opened in a millennium!
Narration/&Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric	Those books are falling to pieces.
Narration/&Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard	Not this one!
Narration/&Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric	Look around for other valuables.
Narration/&Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue	Already doing it!
Narration/&Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena	Hey! Here they are!
Narration/&Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek	I'll be damned… they're alive!
Narration/&Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter	We told you we'd find him.
Narration/&Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena	Hector?
Narration/&Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek	Lena, wait!
Narration/&Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric	What's going on?
Narration/&Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena	That's not Hector!
Narration/&Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter	What?
Narration/&Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue	Then just who are you, friend?
Narration/&Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector	Put down your weapons.
Narration/&Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter	Why would we do that?
Narration/&Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal	This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining.
Narration/&Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default	Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal	Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here.
Narration/&Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal	Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal	Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?
Narration/&Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default	Here for the Council job? Join the club. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative	If you're here for the Council job, get in line.
Narration/&Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly	You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default	Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative	Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him.
Narration/&Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly	Grab a chair. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default	Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default	Looks like you've been waiting here a while.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal	I see you're all making the best of this.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang	So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?
Narration/&Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal	We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?
Narration/&Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal	Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?
Narration/&Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal	Well, I was making my way here… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal	…when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal	They dragged me off to some decrepit prison… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal	…and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss.
Narration/&Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang	Well, I was heading down a lonely road… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang	…when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang	…and threw my ass in this rundown jail.
Narration/&Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang	Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there.
Narration/&Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal	I was heading down the highway, minding my own business…
Narration/&Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal	…when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me.
Narration/&Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal	They carried me off to some ramshackle prison.
Narration/&Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal	An Imperial ruin of some sort… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal	Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking.
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal	…Don't know what was holding the place up… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang	…a strong wind coulda taken it down.
Narration/&Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal	Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear.
Narration/&Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal	So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!
Narration/&Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal	My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical	Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful	This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal	Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be.
Narration/&Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy	I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat	The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience.
Narration/&Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife	You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready.
Narration/&Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal	Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent	I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain.
Narration/&Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang	So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?
Narration/&Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal	Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy.
Narration/&Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal	Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told.
Narration/&Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default	What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!
Narration/&Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal	I don't remember anyone asking your opinion.
Narration/&Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent	Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!
Narration/&Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly	That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky.
Narration/&Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default	The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!
Narration/&Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal	Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger.
Narration/&Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical	Everyone's a critic.
Narration/&Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar	I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures.
Narration/&Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default	Aren't all drunks basically stupid?
Narration/&Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default	Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default	…I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal	What?
Narration/&Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang	Bullshit!
Narration/&Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal	That is preposterous.
Narration/&Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal	High in the hills, two days west of here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal	I left the main road to find a shorter way through… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal	And I was making good time… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal	…when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave.
Narration/&Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang	I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang	…and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut.
Narration/&Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang	It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang	…and fell right into a blasted hole.
Narration/&Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal	I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal	…hoping to save time by traversing the hills.
Narration/&Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal	The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path.
Narration/&Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal	Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres	Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs.
Narration/&Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence	I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters.
Narration/&Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical	You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell.
Narration/&Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default	Orcs have a very distinctive stink.
Narration/&Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical	I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence	If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger.
Narration/&Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful	We should bill the Council for all this wasted time.
Narration/&Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default	We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us.
Narration/&Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default	Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business.
Narration/&Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang	Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!
Narration/&Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal	We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal	You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?
Narration/&Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default	Fine - you want to know the truth?
Narration/&Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default	I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine… 
Narration/&Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default	And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark.
Narration/&Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal	Oh, that's not good.
Narration/&Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang	Sounds like an idiot.
Narration/&Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal	So he was in dire straits?
Narration/&Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default	Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it.
Narration/&Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default	Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary. 
Narration/&Tavern_041_Carran_NPC	Are you four here to see Lord Carran?
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN	We're not here to get drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Who's asking?
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN	Maybe we're here looking for a fight.
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical	Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic	Depends on who's asking.
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence	Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC	Well, thank you for making that clear…
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC	A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_NPC	Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN	So you're real, then?
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN	We're ready.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN	We should get paid for waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical	So you're not a mythical creature after all.
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful	Then we are here at your service, sir.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy	Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical	Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful	Very good.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy	Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh.
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal	Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal	Can you tell us more about the job?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang	We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord.
Narration/&Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC	Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing. 
Narration/&Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC	What do you want to know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN	About the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN	About the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN	Are you our employer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN	We're good, thank you.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio	We should be going, don't you think?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice	What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01	We don't exactly have the time…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02	…anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03	We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04	…through a pass called the Copperhead Road.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05	We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06	Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07	While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08	…though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice	Are we going to work for you?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01	Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02	That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice	We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01	Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02	I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03	The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04	It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN	What are the Badlands?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice	What are the Badlands, really?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01	Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02	It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03	Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN	What are the Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice	Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01	Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02	The Snow Alliance lies to the north.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03	The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04	And the New Empire, to the south.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05	All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN	What organizations are there?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice	What are the organizations you mentioned?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01	The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02	Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03	Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04	And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN	We know enough.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice	I think we know enough now. Thank you!
Narration/&Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC	Very well.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_NPC	Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in.
Narration/&Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful	Whose fault is that? 
Narration/&Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical	Hurry up and wait. The story of my life.
Narration/&Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic	I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_FindTools	Liam… always thoughtful.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01	There you are, you filthy crook!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark	You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02	Think you scare me? Not anymore!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2	A grave mistake.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal	Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal	Ow! That's going to leave a mark.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang	Damn! That hurt like hell.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy	Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm	Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker	Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass	My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy	Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental	Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean	Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical	An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal	What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal	What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang	Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs	There they are… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal	…if they see me, I'm dead.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal	…discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang	…head down, or I'm next on the menu.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal	What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal	No other means of egress is apparent.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang	They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal	I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal	Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang	Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable.
Narration/&Council_00_1_Wow_Default	Look at this size of this Council hall!
Narration/&Council_00_2_Wow_Default	A very impressive edifice indeed.
Narration/&Council_00_3_joker_Default	So this is what they spend our taxes on.
Narration/&Council_00_4_Any_Default	Look! Is that… 
Narration/&Council_00_5_Any_Default	The Princess!
Narration/&Council_00_6_Any_Default	Wait… is she leaving?
Narration/&Council_00_7_joker_Default	Apparently so… 
Narration/&Council_00_8_Any_Default	Then who will administer the oath?
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN	The maid who empties her chamber pot?
Narration/&Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN	We're too low for her.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN	It's not her role.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default	The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Slang	A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice	There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think.
Narration/&Council_00_10_Carran_NPC	You thought it would be the Princess? 
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN	She doesn't rule the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN	If not her, then who?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default	Doesn't she lead the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC	No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate.
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice	If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02	Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all.
Narration/&Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC	Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council_00_16_Carran_NPC	Yes, m'lady!
Narration/&Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC	Are these your new deputies?
Narration/&Council_00_18_Carran_NPC	They are, m'lady.
Narration/&Council_00_19_Serious_Default	Very well. Pay attention. All of you.
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Slang	Pipe down. 
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Normal	Shhh, quiet everyone!
Narration/&Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC	My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council.
Narration/&Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC	And I will be administering your vows.
Narration/&Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC	Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go.
Narration/&Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC	Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always.
Narration/&Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC	Now, please, raise your right hands.
Narration/&Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC	Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise… 
Narration/&Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC	…to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN	I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default	I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC	Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&Council_00_30_Carran_NPC	Congratulations, deputies.
Narration/&Council_00_31_Any_Default	Wait, that's it?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN	You were expecting a parade?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN	That was long enough.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN	Let's focus on the mission.
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Default	What were you expecting? A parade? 
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Slang	Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?
Narration/&Council_00_33_Any_Default	I suppose you imagined something more pompous.
Narration/&Council_00_34_Any_Default	No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic.
Narration/&Council_00_35_Carran_NPC	Sorry to disappoint. 
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice	Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01	The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02	But more would probably be… immodest.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice	Stop wasting time! What's the mission?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran	Well! A motivated deputy.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Carran_NPC	So - the mission:
Narration/&Council_00_44_Carran_NPC	As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts… 
Narration/&Council_00_45_Carran_NPC	…to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches.
Narration/&Council_00_46_Carran_NPC	One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council_00_47_Carran_NPC	It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_48_Carran_NPC	He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to.
Narration/&Council_00_49_Carran_NPC	We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks.
Narration/&Council_00_50_Carran_NPC	Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive.
Narration/&Council_00_51_Carran_NPC	If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back.
Narration/&Council_00_52_Carran_NPC	The Council wants a first-hand report.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN	Sounds dangerous.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN	Wait - you spoke of the Marches?
Narration/&Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN	Tell us about Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN	We're good to go.
Narration/&Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice	A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us.
Narration/&Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01	Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Normal	Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Slang	We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger.
Narration/&Council_00_59_Carran_NPC	You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Carran_NPC	So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence.
Narration/&Council_00_60_Marches_Choice	Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?
Narration/&Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01	The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02	It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03	We wouldn't send you in there… yet.
Narration/&Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice	What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?
Narration/&Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01	A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army.
Narration/&Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02	He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Any_Default	Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Hello! How may I help you?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN	What do you sell?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	Can we see your wares?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default	What do you sell here?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC	I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC	And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Come back any time - I'm almost always open!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC	Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN	Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	What do you sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN	Can we see your wares?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default	Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC	That's me! The one and only.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default	What do you have to sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC	Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC	…food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC	I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins. 
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC	They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC	Hello, adventurers!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC	What can I offer you?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	Tell us about this place.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN	Your beer tastes bad.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN	We need a room.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN	Goodbye.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any	We should go.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default	Tell us about your tavern.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC	The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC	You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC	An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC	We also have rooms to rent by the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default	Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC	It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default	Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC	What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC	Maybe your palate is not refined enough.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default	We'd like to stay for the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC	Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default	A suite? 
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC	It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay	No money, eh. No room, then. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello	Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye	Stay in the light, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC	Deputies? A word, if you please.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default	So famous already? I love it!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default	You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC	I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC	We don't have a seat in there, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC	…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC	That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC	You'll need our services, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default	Is that… compulsory?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC	No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC	Did lord Carran not tell you?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default	No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC	Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default	We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC	Of course you are. Well, good luck!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default	At least she's not another lady or something.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default	Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default	They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default	Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default	I'd rather visit the temple, honestly.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default	The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default	So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default	It's not far, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default	I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default	If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC	Ah - you came!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default	You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC	You don't know? Tsk.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	What help do you offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN	Do you know Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN	See you later.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default	What kind of help do you offer to people like us?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC	Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC	…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default	Who's Captain Merran?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC	You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC	Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC	…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default	Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC	Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC	And stop interrupting! It's rude.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC	So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC	…too much for you to lug back here.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default	Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC	So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC	Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC	…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC	We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default	For a percentage, of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC	What? You could never carry it all, anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC	Not in your little backpacks.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default	Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC	Of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default	That's it?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC	Merton… it's a painful topic for me. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC	I'd rather not talk about him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default	Fair enough.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default	Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC	No, we don't. There's a shop for that.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC	However…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC	We've got something even better.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC	Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default	Here we go again…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC	Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC	Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC	We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC	It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC	Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default	That's not cheap, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC	Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default	Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC	Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default	Are there others?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC	Anywhere we can settle. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC	By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default	In what?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC	In getting our people to Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC	The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default	Right, we'll tell him if we find him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC	That would be appreciated. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC	The more you do for us, the more we do for you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default	Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC	And I hope it will, friend.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default	I guess we'll see you around, then.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC	Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag	So that's Caer Lem?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag	We're almost there… it's just up the hill.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag	It's a little too quiet, don't you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang	We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal	True. Let's keep our eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal	Quite so. We must be on our guard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal	Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal	Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal	Who put you in charge?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang	Don't play the captain with me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal	I'm just saying, be ready for anything.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal	Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang	Damn right. Let's get on with it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal	All right. Let's just keep going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal	Agreed. We should press on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag	I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang	Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal	There's no one here. Not even corpses.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag	Look! That tower… that's insane!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag	Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag	It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang	Courtesy of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang	The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal	I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal	We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag	Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal	Well, that's not a good sign.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal	Does this tell us anything we don't already know?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal	The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal	There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal	Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal	Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal	Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag	There's definitely been fighting here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag	Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal	No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React	This is no time for jokes.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag	Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag	We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal	Did you see that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang	What the heck was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default	Someone's hiding inside the tower.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default	It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default	Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default	We need to get up to that door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default	That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default	If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC	Back off! No closer!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default	Who's there?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC	We're not letting you in!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC	And we're not coming out!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default	Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC	Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC	Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC	They'll cast a spell on you!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC	Don't touch me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal	Is something not right in there, or is it just me?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang	Lost their minds, the lot of 'em.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal	Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal	Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang	That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default	Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default	…we can show them our Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC	They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC	You damn Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default	Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default	Did they say Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang	Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal	You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC	You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC	Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN	We're Council deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN	Use spy call phrase
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN	Use sellsword experience
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN	Be reasonable!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal	We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck	Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck	Open the damn door, there are only four of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck	They have Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck	Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default	So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC	What?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default	What was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default	Just fishing. Give it a moment.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC	Magic pillows give us sweet dreams.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default	I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC	Sandreed, eh? Which unit?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC	What happened to "don't talk to them"?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default	The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default	He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default	Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC	Open up… they're not Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default	Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC	Exactly what a Sorak would say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default	Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC	Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC	Fine with me. Daliat, open the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC	No! I said no!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC	Close the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default	Thank you for letting us in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC	Don't thank me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN	Are you the officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN	You thought we were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN	Can we talk to the others?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default	Are you in charge here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC	Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC	Second in command… After Captain Henrik.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default	So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC	Man-sized lizards that can speak? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC	Oh, yeah… they're real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC	But we found no corpses… nothing.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC	We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC	So no one can prove they exist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	That's awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	That's hard to believe.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	That's garbage.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal	No proof… that's kind of awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal	You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang	Course they did… just to make you look crazy.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC	You won't laugh when they come back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default	We got here without trouble.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC	Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default	Why would they do that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC	How should I know? They're Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang	Mind if we talk to your buddies?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal	Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal	We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC	As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default	I might have a better chance with this guy… alone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default	I don't like being kept in the dark.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default	I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default	He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default	He looks like any other beggar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default	Come on, trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default	What exactly is it between you and him?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default	We trust you to do what's best for us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default	Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default	Leave the goddess out of this, will you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default	If you do then, please, be our guest.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC	I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC	How do you know the code?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default	I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC	I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default	I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC	We'll see.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default	So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC	Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default	So… Soraks? Really?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC	What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC	The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC	Even hiding their bodies is in the stories.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default	Think they're still around?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC	Possibly.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default	Any idea what they're after?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC	No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default	Right. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default	They'll want to talk to you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC	Fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default	He's all yours.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default	So who are you, friend?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC	Daliat Sunbird, scout.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default	Do you believe they were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC	Dunno. Seemed real, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default	What do you think they wanted? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC	To kill us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal	Not big on talk, eh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal	You seem a very reluctant conversationalist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC	I'm gonna rest now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC	I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC	Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC	Nice man.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default	How about you? Did you learn anything?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default	Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default	So much for your secret code.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default	Sorry to disappoint.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC	Now it's my turn, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default	What do you mean?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC	What is this? A murder investigation?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN	Should it be?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Just trying to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN	Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default	Should we be investigating?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC	Maybe. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal	You've said too much to stop now. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal	Speak up, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC	Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal	Go on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang	Spit it out.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal	Speak up without fear, friend.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC	The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC	Found a ruin, came back with loot. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC	The next day, this happens. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC	Coincidence? You tell me. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default	The scouts, you say?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC	Only one of them's still alive.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC	Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default	Right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default	We just want to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC	Good luck with that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default	You sound worried. Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC	Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Sorry.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN	You're hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN	I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN	Go to hell.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default	No offense intended.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default	I'll take that as a yes. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default	I don't like to be insulted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default	You go to hell, you spineless moron.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC	You should work on your manners, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC	And I don't like to be accused of… whatever. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN	We started on the wrong foot.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN	Speak up, or else!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN	We know there's a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default	Get lost.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default	Can we start this over?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success	Listen. Something's not right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure	I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default	You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC	Friends, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC	Bring it on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default	We know there's a traitor among you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default	Help us, and we'll help you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success	I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC	Shh! He's looking at us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC	I'll tell you what.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure	You think you can fool me that easily?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC	I don't buy it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes	You must have a hearing problem, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default	Hey, there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal	Greetings, soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC	Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC	Name's Robar Sharp.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal	Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal	I gather you are a veteran of long standing?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang	So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC	Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default	Tell us about Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default	Tell us about Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default	Tell us about Lisbath.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default	What should we do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default	Mercenary small talk
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default	This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC	Clearly not. Look around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC	Losing the captain broke her.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default	What do you think of Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC	Never liked him. He's hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC	He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC	But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal	Very wise.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal	I understand.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default	How about Lisbath? You're her superior?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC	Good woman. Strong, brave.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC	You can trust her with a sword… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC	…that's worth something in my book.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default	So you fought at Sandreed too?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC	Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC	Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default	Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC	That's the plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default	So what do you think we should do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC	For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default	But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default	Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC	You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default	So if we find a way, you're with us?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default	I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal	Right… we need to make a decision here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal	It's clear that something must be done.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal	The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal	I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang	They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal	We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal	They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang	Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal	If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal	Let them. Could be fun to watch.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal	This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal	So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal	And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal	What if he really is hiding something important?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN	We confront him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN	He might be a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN	It's just gossip.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Let's not risk a fight.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal	We need to talk to him, find out the truth.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer	If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer	It's just paranoia, or personal grudges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer	If we accuse him, it might end in blood.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer	That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN	We take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN	We get out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN	Let's talk to them all together.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN	We push Sharp to mutiny.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer	We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer	We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer	Let's just get them together and discuss this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer	We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction	All right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction	I'm not sure, but… fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction	Agreed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction	I don't think that's a good idea.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction	We can't do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default	We need to talk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC	Do we?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN	Not now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN	You were with an expedition recently.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout	Well… maybe later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal	Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal	About this trip to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC	That's what we do, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default	The Soraks attacked after you came back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC	So what - I brought them here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default	Listen, colleague… you can trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC	You, maybe… but the others? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default	Did you bring something back?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC	We always do, like the Scavengers.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC	Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default	But maybe this time, you took something special.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC	It's nothing of value to Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default	How would you know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default	Show me, colleague.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default	Just trust us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default	We could simply take it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default	We can pay for it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default	We're not blaming you, but we need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC	It's just an old book… might be of historical value.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC	Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default	The Council will reward you if you help us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC	You won't buy me with words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default	Show us, or we'll help ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC	I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC	No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade	Trust us. We're all on the same side here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC	We just need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC	Hey, what's that? Hey!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations	Hey, there!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations	Deputies.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN	Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN	We want you to take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout	Never mind. We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC	Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal	Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC	She'll refuse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal	We'll back you up. She won't have a choice.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC	No can do… it won't work.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC	Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC	What's that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal	We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC	Him? Just like that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal	We order it, as deputies of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC	Bullshit.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC	Told ya.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal	Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC	In your dreams!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC	He'll get you killed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal	She took that well.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal	So boss, what's the plan?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal	Right then, what do you say, officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC	What the… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked	Lieutenant!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default	Can we talk?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC	What now?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN	We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN	You should step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout	Sorry, we'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl	You do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default	You need to step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC	Oh? And why is that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal	This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal	Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang	Because you're no damn use… that's why!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC	You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN	We are taking command.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN	Robar should lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN	Your ancestors would agree.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default	We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC	You… well… chain of command, I suppose.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC	Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC	Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default	Robar Sharp will command in your stead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC	A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default	He's capable enough.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default	Mind your words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default	Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC	Maybe you're right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC	I can't believe you're doing this to me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal	How dare you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang	Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal	I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC	Hey, what's that… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked	Robar!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC	You've got some explaining to do…
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default	Daliat was hiding this from you.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal	We believe it may have attracted the Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal	That's probably why they attacked.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default	He refused to let it go, despite the danger.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC	I'm not surprised. 
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC	Me neither.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC	That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC	Wait… what… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC	Robar, no!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC	I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC	You… this is all your fault… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default	Soldiers die. You should know that.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default	Maraike will take his soul to peace.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default	Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default	…and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default	Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC	You people - just leave me alone!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC	You can't do that! 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default	He came from here! Look!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default	What's this? A secret passage?
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default	From Imperial times… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default	That was just a scout… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default	…more will be coming.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default	They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default	They're coming back! Outside!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default	We need to go! Take your stuff.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default	Into the secret passage, before it's too late!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC	I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC	I should have… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default	Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC	Soraks… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC	Right. Who's crazy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default	We must alert the Council!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal	We need to get out of here, that's what we need!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal	Surviving is what matters now.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal	Look at that skin! It's unbelievable… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC	Oh, no… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC	You know she had it coming. She failed us.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default	Happy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC	We didn't do this… the… Sorak did.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default	Right, then. They are real.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default	This is unbelievable! The Council must know!
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default	And we need to leave, or we'll be next.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default	This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default	Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default	Seems quiet. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default	We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default	Hey, where's Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default	He was here a moment ago.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default	The Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC	Daliat always had his own secrets. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC	I think he just went his own way.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default	And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC	Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC	Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal	Think they're Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal	Are those Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default	Who else?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default	We can surprise them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default	Can't we sneak around?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default	From what I see, not a chance.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default	All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default	What do you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default	Typical Manacalon architecture… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default	…the stonecutting is textbook… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default	…using this orange stone from the mountain.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default	That's it? Orange stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal	Is that all? Stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default	I'm not answering that.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal	I won't dignify that question with an answer.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno	Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno	I guess it's… good stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno	Well, that was enlightening.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal	What's this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal	What is this thing?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal	I think it was a Minor Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal	I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default	At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default	To magically travel through the Empire.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default	I don't suppose it still works?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default	Some say there are still functioning Gates.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default	And this plaque? Any value?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default	Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default	This one didn't die yesterday.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default	What's this outfit?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default	Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default	Who wants to open this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default	You never know, there might be a fortune in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default	Can anyone read that?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default	It's old Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default	It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default	So that's from… the tower up there?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default	Maybe we're inside the tower?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default	Is that gold?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default	This is history. History, all around us!
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default	Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default	We're safe!
Narration/&CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default	We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default	The road isn't far.
Narration/&CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal	We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?
Narration/&CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal	I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?
Narration/&CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC	Of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC	Sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC	Yeah.
Narration/&Council01_1_NPC_Carran	Oh, here you are!
Narration/&Council01_2_NPC_Carran	How was the mission?
Narration/&Council01_3_Any_Practical	Successful.
Narration/&Council01_4_Any_Exalted	You won't believe it!
Narration/&Council01_5_Any_Cynical	We almost died!
Narration/&Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar	We must report to the Council immediately.
Narration/&Council01_7_Any_Greedy	Not paid enough.
Narration/&Council01_8_Any_Seenitall	Business as usual.
Narration/&Council01_9_Any_Violent	Let's say we earned a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran	Good.
Narration/&Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran	Let's hope the Council does, then!
Narration/&Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran	Yes here you are, safe and sound.
Narration/&Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran	Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned.
Narration/&Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran	Who is?
Narration/&Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran	I appreciate your professionalism.
Narration/&Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran	There's no dishonor in a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_17_Any_Practical	When can we hope for an audience?
Narration/&Council01_18_NPC_Carran	It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky. 
Narration/&Council01_19_NPC_Carran	Another party came back yesterday… 
Narration/&Council01_20_NPC_Carran	…and they still have to make their report, so… 
Narration/&Council01_21_NPC_Carran	…maybe they'll see you both at once.
Narration/&Council01_22_Any_Practical	We have urgent news!
Narration/&Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang	Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!
Narration/&Council01_24_Any_Practical	The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!
Narration/&Council01_25_Any_Practical	Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_26_NPC_Carran	By all the gods!
Narration/&Council01_27_NPC_Carran	Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_28_NPC_Carran	I'll inform my superiors.
Narration/&Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar	This cannot wait!
Narration/&Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar	The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar	Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_32_NPC_Carran	Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_33_NPC_Carran	Is that a joke?
Narration/&Council01_34_Any_Other	I'm afraid not. 
Narration/&Council01_35_Any_Other_slang	We saw them… with our own eyes!
Narration/&Council01_36_NPC_Carran	Well, if you want to bring that to the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_37_NPC_Carran	…that's your decision.
Narration/&Council01_38_NPC_Carran	If you're so eager to look like idiots… 
Narration/&Council01_39_NPC_Carran	Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_40_NPC_Speaker	The Legacy Council is now in session.
Narration/&Council01_41_NPC_Speaker	Captain Heather Merran has the floor.
Narration/&Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness… 
Narration/&Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan	…my party and I have made a very worrying discovery.
Narration/&Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan	In the Badlands… 
Narration/&Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan	…near the place we call Black Hill… 
Narration/&Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan	…we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers.
Narration/&Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan	They attacked us right away… 
Narration/&Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan	…but we were able to fight them off.
Narration/&Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan	They were trying to get away with this.
Narration/&Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	What is it?
Narration/&Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan	This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear.
Narration/&Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan	We have determined that it has magical properties… 
Narration/&Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan	…and we believe the Council should examine it.
Narration/&Council01_54_NPC_Danantar	So we will, captain, but really… 
Narration/&Council01_55_NPC_Danantar	…is that all? 
Narration/&Council01_56_NPC_Danantar	You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?
Narration/&Council01_57_NPC_Danantar	Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule… 
Narration/&Council01_58_NPC_Princess	Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic.
Narration/&Council01_59_NPC_Danantar	Hear, hear!
Narration/&Council01_60_NPC_Danantar	Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business… 
Narration/&Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan	They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_62_NPC_Danantar	… 
Narration/&Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Is this a joke?
Narration/&Council01_65_NPC_Einar	The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!
Narration/&Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Oh, you know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_67_NPC_Princess	What do you mean, my lord?
Narration/&Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech	How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	At least twenty, I'd say.
Narration/&Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	More. Twenty-three.
Narration/&Council01_71_NPC_Danantar	More each year. It's becoming a fad.
Narration/&Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech	I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default	We did, too!
Narration/&Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted	It's true! They're real!
Narration/&Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative	If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!
Narration/&Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical	She's telling the truth!
Narration/&Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech	What?
Narration/&Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech	And who might you be?
Narration/&Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean	Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently.
Narration/&Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech	New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems.
Narration/&Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean	They assure me that they saw Soraks as well.
Narration/&Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Wait!
Narration/&Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Do you realize how serious this is?
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN	We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN	We saw them.
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN	They attacked Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1	We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2	The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3	They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!
Narration/&Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1	We have never had two sightings reported at the same time.
Narration/&Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1	Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?
Narration/&Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2	Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?
Narration/&Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2	Yes, sir!
Narration/&Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2	Reptilians… fast, strong… 
Narration/&Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	…they can climb on walls just like spiders!
Narration/&Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default	…they're tough, too!
Narration/&Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3	Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches? 
Narration/&Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3	What do you mean by heavy losses?
Narration/&Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	The Soraks took over captain Henrik… 
Narration/&Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	…and only two of them are still alive.
Narration/&Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	They can testify, too.
Narration/&Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir	Do you have any… material proof of their existence?
Narration/&Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	I beg your pardon?
Narration/&Council01_101_NPC_Morgan	Like what?
Narration/&Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Well… A dead body, for example!
Narration/&Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Or even just a head?
Narration/&Council01_104_NPC_Einar	If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Probably not.
Narration/&Council01_106_NPC_Morgan	They took their dead with them when they retreated.
Narration/&Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	The bodies of their victims, too.
Narration/&Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Hm! How very convenient!
Narration/&Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech	So you can offer us no proof of this… 
Narration/&Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech	…adventurer's fable.
Narration/&Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?
Narration/&Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech	What proof? How? 
Narration/&Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech	If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say.
Narration/&Council01_114_NPC_Danantar	That's not our problem. Let them find a way.
Narration/&Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	These are new recruits, correct?
Narration/&Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	Then let this be their new mission:
Narration/&Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see.
Narration/&Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?
Narration/&Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem.
Narration/&Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech	If there is nothing else?
Narration/&Council01_121_NPC_Speaker	Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!
Narration/&Council01_122_NPC_Speaker	Does any member object?
Narration/&Council01_123_NPC_Speaker	No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!
Narration/&Council01_124_NPC_Carran	That actually went better than I expected.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN	Who's the grumpy dwarf?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN	We had to stand by Merran.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN	The Princess is bland.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN	They are seat-warmers.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical	Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar	We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility	I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin	They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces.
Narration/&Council01_129_NPC_Carran	Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Council01_130_NPC_Carran	She's… Well, yes. Quite.
Narration/&Council01_131_NPC_Carran	I'm sure she will appreciate your support.
Narration/&Council01_132_NPC_Carran	Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN	Someone older.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN	Someone… a little more presentable?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN	Someone more dignified.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical	A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait… 
Narration/&Council01_134_NPC_Carran	Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_135_NPC_Carran	…but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality.
Narration/&Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative	A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?
Narration/&Council01_137_NPC_Carran	Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities.
Narration/&Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility	Someone more… regal?
Narration/&Council01_139_NPC_Carran	No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!
Narration/&Council01_140_Player_Nobility	You know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_141_NPC_Carran	No, actually… I don't.
Narration/&Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin	A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!
Narration/&Council01_143_NPC_Carran	And your employers, let's not forget.
Narration/&Council01_144_NPC_Carran	I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body.
Narration/&Council01_145_NPC_Carran	Anyway… 
Narration/&Council01_146_NPC_Carran	…some people might want to talk to you after this.
Narration/&Council01_147_NPC_Carran	Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral.
Narration/&Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default	But?
Narration/&Council01_149_NPC_Carran	But you have the right to have friends.
Narration/&Council01_150_NPC_Carran	So feel free to talk to whoever you like.
Narration/&Council01_151_NPC_Carran	As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole.
Narration/&Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal	You may rely on our honor.
Narration/&Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal	Of course.
Narration/&Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang	All right, then.
Narration/&Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01	Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!
Narration/&Council01_156_AnyFriendly	You're welcome, Captain. 
Narration/&Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02	So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame.
Narration/&Council01_158_Curious	You knew him?
Narration/&Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03	Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now...
Narration/&Council01_160_Friendly	The Scavengers could lead the way.
Narration/&Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04	Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure.
Narration/&Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05	Stay in the light, friends!
Narration/&Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly	You, too!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC	Well, if it isn't our brave saviors.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default	Good day, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal	Salutations, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC	I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default	The Snow Alliance?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC	I will never step foot in the Badlands again.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default	I understand your reluctance.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal	Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC	I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal	No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal	No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack? 
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC	You mean Daliat?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal	Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal	Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC	As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC	But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal	You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default	Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC	What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC	Greetings, deputies.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal	Are you ready to come clean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default	Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC	Of course it's my name. What are you implying?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default	Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC	Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default	Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC	What do you mean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal	Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC	Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal	You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC	I won't take you there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC	But I can show you the location on a map.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC	Of course, nothing is free.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default	Indeed. Thank you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC	I'm glad we could come to some agreement.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default	As are we.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC	It's just business, after all.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default	Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC	Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default	We did indeed.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal	Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC	Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal	You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC	To what do I owe the honor?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default	We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC	Looking for Soraks, are we?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default	Possibly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC	You people are crazy.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC	Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC	It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default	Appreciate the help, Robar.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC	Though I may have just helped you into an early grave.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default	This time we'll take them by surprise.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC	Right. Good luck with that.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default	Farewell, Robar!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal	What is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal	What's going on here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang	What the hell did we just stumble into?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default	These aren't Soraks. They seem human.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default	What exactly are they doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default	What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang	Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal	This ruin dates back to Imperial times.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default	A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default	Who are these people? Scavengers?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default	Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default	Well, there is one way to find out.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default	Perhaps we should sneak a little closer.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default	Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers01	Alert!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal	All right - no talking, then… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal	Looks like there won't be any parley… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default	So what do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal	Humans.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang	They look like people to me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal	I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal	Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default	What's that symbol there?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default	The tattoo?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default	Looks like an A.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default	They all have it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal	Guess they're all part of the same club.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal	Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default	Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default	Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default	"A" could stand for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default	One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default	Are you kidding me?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default	That's not good.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default	At least we know we're in the right place.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default	Should we see what they're doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default	Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default	If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default	Please don't kill me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default	What are you doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default	I'm just a worker.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default	Are you tattooed with an A?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default	I… you don't understand…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default	Are you one of them?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default	One of what? I'm just trying to survive. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default	I had no choice.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill	You must die.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive	Get out of here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo	Tell us about the tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps	Are the Soraks around?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill	He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive	Run! Run for your life! 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo	What does the tattoo signify?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps	Are the Soraks close by?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default	It's… I can't…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default	He's dead. How is that possible? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default	How is any of this possible?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default	He was doomed from the start.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default	They're here. They're close…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default	If they know that I…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC	Another statue… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal	These guys really loved themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal	These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal	Now, this is an Emperor.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal	A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal	…he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal	Good job managing the trouble, mister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal	He made history, but not the way he would have wanted.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default	This place is astounding.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default	What kind of runes are those?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default	Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default	It is said they had eight schools of magic.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default	Each is represented here. All as equals.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal	We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang	Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal	We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default	That was… unexpected.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default	This place is topsy-turvy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default	Magic from a time long forgotten. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default	Remind me not to take a dump in that hole.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default	Do you really have to make jokes?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default	Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default	Something funny suddenly comes to mind…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default	Can you keep it to yourself?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default	Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default	We did it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default	Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default	Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.  
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default	They didn't die easily.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default	Worthy foes, indeed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal	Thankfully, we prevailed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang	Got every one of those ugly bastards.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal	They bleed just like we do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default	Now we just need one of their bloody heads.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default	Would you look at this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default	A crown of some kind?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default	They seemed to keep their distance from it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default	Maybe it's cursed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default	Look what I found.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default	Let me take a look.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default	What language is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default	Looks like ancient Tirmarian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default	If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang	Is this the language of those damned lizards? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal	That has to be a Sorak name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default	They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default	Take it then. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default	Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default	Perhaps we should rest before we head back.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default	I say we go.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default	Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default	The mission is done after all.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default	Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default	All right, then - I'll do it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default	The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default	After you, friends.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE	Take the Crown
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default	Interesting.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default	It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default	Do you think it has magical properties?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang	By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default	A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default	And I should care because?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal	Who knows what it might contain.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default	A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default	But it looks like it's locked.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default	Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default	First things first. We have a mission to complete.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal	Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang	Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default	Fancy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default	Beautiful craftsmanship.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default	She looks like an empress.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default	She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default	More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default	Could this have been her home?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default	Possibly.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default	If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default	Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default	You are an idiot.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default	You see that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default	Is that a Sorak?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default	Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default	Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default	It's a dragon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default	It's no bigger than a man.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang	No shit?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal	If you say so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal	I don't think so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default	Is this one of those rocks that…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default	Nope. This place is insane.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default	In the Badlands…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default	I know… expect the unexpected. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default	Well, that didn't do a damn thing. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default	Did you really think that would open the door?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default	I need to break some frickin' heads!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default	We need to be smarter about this. Think it through.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default	We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default	Your faces are not the last faces I want to see.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default	Stay hidden. They're here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default	Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default	What else could they be?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal	You ready to do this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal	This is it, friends. Stay strong.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default	Get in position…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default	…hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default	Ready.
Narration/&CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal	You look a little pale. Is something wrong?
Narration/&CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal	Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced.
Narration/&CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default	I don't feel too good. 
Narration/&CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default	I knew that old Crown was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang	Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal	Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default	You don't know that.
Narration/&CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default	Just get rid of it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal	Perhaps we should leave it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default	No, we need it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default	Need it? For what?
Narration/&CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default	For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside.
Narration/&CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default	Are you okay?
Narration/&CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default	I just need to rest for a bit.
Narration/&CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default	Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either.
Narration/&CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default	I'm exhausted as well.
Narration/&CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default	Maybe the curse has affected us all.
Narration/&CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default	Stop it. Don't be ridiculous.
Narration/&CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default	Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp.
Narration/&CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal	I propose we set up camp and get some rest.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default	We did it! We brought back proof!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal	Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default	How do you feel?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default	Better.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default	Maybe that sickness was nothing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal	It might have been a simple fever, after all.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default	What about the Crown?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default	You know the Council will probably take it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default	No!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default	We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang	We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default	It's our loot! Ours!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default	We have to declare anything of historical value… 
Narration/&BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default	…and they have the right to buy it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default	And if it's priceless?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default	Come on! They can do whatever they want.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default	Sure.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default	I guess we'll see.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal	We must wait and see, and hope for the best.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default	Who fought the Soraks - us or them?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal	They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal	We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_1_1_Partner_Default	Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC	Ah - deputies! 
Narration/&Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC	I see you found some nice shiny loot.
Narration/&Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC	So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?
Narration/&Council02_1_4_Partner_Default	One head, slightly damaged.
Narration/&Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC	Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!
Narration/&Council02_1_6_Partner_Default	At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive.
Narration/&Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC	I can only imagine.
Narration/&Council02_1_8_Partner_Default	When's the next Council meeting?
Narration/&Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC	When? Now, of course!
Narration/&Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC	The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace.
Narration/&Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC	They're waiting for you.
Narration/&Council02_1_12_Partner_Default	They are?
Narration/&Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC	Well, more for… this. But come on!
Narration/&Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC	Now, there's a trophy.
Narration/&Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC	And by the way, who's crazy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_16_Default_Default	All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC	Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me.
Narration/&Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default	Maybe it's a curse.
Narration/&Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC	The curse of being surrounded by idiots… 
Narration/&Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC	If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to.
Narration/&Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC	Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_22_Default_Default	Who's this guy again?
Narration/&Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC	Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say.
Narration/&Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC	But now - well, you can see for yourself.
Narration/&Council02_1_25_Curious_Default	Who's this old lady?
Narration/&Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC	Just ignore him.
Narration/&Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC	Let's go.
Narration/&Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC	Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC	I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe.
Narration/&Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC	Well, then - it seems we have a problem.
Narration/&Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC	It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!
Narration/&Council02_2_5_Partner_Default	There's something else.
Narration/&Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC	What?
Narration/&Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC	A Crown?
Narration/&Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC	Interesting. A very nice find.
Narration/&Council02_2_9_Partner_Default	We don't want to sell it.
Narration/&Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC	Why not? You know we pay well.
Narration/&Council02_2_11_Partner_Default	We want to keep it.
Narration/&Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC	I'd like to take a look at it, though.
Narration/&Council02_2_13_Partner_Default	… 
Narration/&Council02_2_14_Authority_Default	Come on, let them take a look.
Narration/&Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC	Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC	Any ideas?
Narration/&Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC	It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style… 
Narration/&Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC	These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic… 
Narration/&Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC	I have a spell I'd like to cast on this.
Narration/&Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC	My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!
Narration/&Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC	What?
Narration/&Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default	What happened?
Narration/&Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default	You passed out.
Narration/&Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default	Where are we?
Narration/&Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default	The Temple of Einar.
Narration/&Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default	Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here.
Narration/&Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default	We certainly made an impression on the Council.
Narration/&Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default	They believe you're attuned to the Crown… 
Narration/&Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default	…that you can't be separated from it.
Narration/&Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default	What? So it is cursed?
Narration/&Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default	They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped.
Narration/&Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default	They cast spells on the crown, on you… 
Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default	Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there.
Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default	They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready.
Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default	But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	It's an honor, deputies.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default	Who are you?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	I'm just a junior aide in the Council…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	…but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	…just see me at the Tower, downtown.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default	Why the sudden interest in us?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	You proved yourselves in the Badlands…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	…and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default	All right - we'll think about it.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC	Greetings, Sorak slayers!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default	Hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC	I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC	I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default	You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC	We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC	…how about that for neutrality?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC	Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. 
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC	We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default	Like the Scavengers?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC	The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC	But we can offer more than gold.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC	Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default	Good to know. Thanks for the invitation.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority	We're in kind of a hurry.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I know. I won't delay you long.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default	And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default	You're smarter than you look.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Also quite indifferent to mockery.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default	Really? Not at the embassy?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default	What? How did he… ?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default	That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default	Maybe he just agrees about the taste.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Would you have a moment, deputies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default	All right, but make it quick.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC	I'll do my best.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC	I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default	The same magic school where the Princess studies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Exactly. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default	Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC	That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default	Fine.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC	I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default	He talked a lot, for sure.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC	He's a man of great authority.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC	He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC	You can find me at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default	Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC	In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default	More than the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC	They would disagree - but yes.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC	…that would be troubling to many on the Council.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default	Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Of course. Neutrality is the rule.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Good day to you, deputies.
Narration/&Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC	Ah - our crownbearer is up again!
Narration/&Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC	Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!
Narration/&Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC	Lord Danantar has the floor.
Narration/&Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC	Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC	I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown.
Narration/&Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC	It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen.
Narration/&Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC	I strongly recommend against forcing a separation.
Narration/&Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC	Chancellor Gormsdottir?
Narration/&Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment.
Narration/&Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently.
Narration/&Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	I have reason to believe that it might be… 
Narration/&Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!
Narration/&Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC	What have you done?
Narration/&Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC	Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!
Narration/&Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC	Wait!
Narration/&Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC	Are you going to faint again?
Narration/&Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	I just had a… vision, I guess it was.
Narration/&Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	I must… find the other gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer	I just had a vision.
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer	It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer	The Crown wants the other gems back.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC	A vision? In an instant?
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default	I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default	Then… who were you?
Narration/&Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default	A paladin… powerful… 
Narration/&Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default	…from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC	That is… unsettling.
Narration/&Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now.
Narration/&Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC	I concur.
Narration/&Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC	What about this artifact? The other gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC	What?
Narration/&Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default	I think I can find them. I can… feel them.
Narration/&Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC	You said it wasn't sentient.
Narration/&Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC	This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible.
Narration/&Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC	Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest.
Narration/&Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC	Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed.
Narration/&Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC	In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?
Narration/&Council02_5_22_All_NPC	Aye!
Narration/&Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC	Your Royal Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC	Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur… 
Narration/&Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC	To which proposition, Your Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC	I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC	So resolved! Let it be recorded!
Narration/&Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC	Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess.
Narration/&Council02_5_29_Char1_Default	What was that?
Narration/&Council02_5_30_Char1_Default	You had a vision?
Narration/&Council02_5_31_Char2_Default	What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default	I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission.
Narration/&Council02_5_33_Char3_Default	All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?
Narration/&Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default	I think… the Crown knows.
Narration/&Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC	Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!
Narration/&Merton_01_2_Any_Default	It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC	Damn right!
Narration/&Merton_01_4_Any_Default	First Scavenger? Where does that come from?
Narration/&Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC	Long story, kid.
Narration/&Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC	Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first.
Narration/&Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC	Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing.
Narration/&Merton_01_8_Any_Default	What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?
Narration/&Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC	Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them.
Narration/&Merton_01_10_Any_Default	You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?
Narration/&Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC	Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all.
Narration/&Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC	The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands.
Narration/&Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC	But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure.
Narration/&Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC	It's because I got them figured out.
Narration/&Merton_01_15_Any_Default	Figured out how?
Narration/&Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC	This Legacy Council is full of it.
Narration/&Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC	Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other.
Narration/&Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC	Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift.
Narration/&Merton_01_19_Any_Default	Uh - okay…
Narration/&Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC	Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?
Narration/&Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!
Narration/&Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC	Lord Keenmind has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC	Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum… 
Narration/&Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC	…have gathered crucial information about this Crown.
Narration/&Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC	This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions… 
Narration/&Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC	…ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC	At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools.
Narration/&Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC	In time of need, each the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC	Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers… 
Narration/&Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC	…that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power.
Narration/&Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC	Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council03_13_All_NPC	overlapping murmurs
Narration/&Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC	Indeed.
Narration/&Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC	Now… there is some debate about… 
Narration/&Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC	…whether the Crown, with all its gems… 
Narration/&Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC	…could possibly open another Rift…
Narration/&Council03_18_All_NPC	overlapping protestations
Narration/&Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC	…or even reopen the previous one.
Narration/&Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC	Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!
Narration/&Council03_21_Danantar_NPC	Solasta paid a high enough price for that!
Narration/&Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Have you been to the Badlands recently?
Narration/&Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC	Order!
Narration/&Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC	Marshal Sunblaze has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC	For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…
Narration/&Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC	…we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC	Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC	Impossible!
Narration/&Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC	The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence.
Narration/&Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC	A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift? 
Narration/&Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC	It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!
Narration/&Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC	No one knows for sure what the Crown can do.
Narration/&Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC	It's a theory.
Narration/&Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC	As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells… 
Narration/&Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC	…that is one of its mysterious powers.
Narration/&Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC	Then why would the Soraks think they know better?
Narration/&Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC	Because they're Soraks!
Narration/&Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC	Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!
Narration/&Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC	While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive.
Narration/&Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC	Fables and conjectures!
Narration/&Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Perhaps.
Narration/&Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC	But can we take the risk?
Narration/&Council03_43_Danantar_NPC	The Crown must be secured!
Narration/&Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC	The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules.
Narration/&Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC	The quest for the gems should be completed.
Narration/&Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers.
Narration/&Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC	These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense.
Narration/&Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?
Narration/&Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC	This is nonsense!
Narration/&Council03_50_Princess_NPC	Maybe the deputies would like to speak.
Narration/&Council03_51_Princess_NPC	After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN	We'll continue the quest.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN	Give us weapons.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN	You should trust us more.
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN	The Crown is ours.
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal	We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems.
Narration/&Council03_53_Authority_Formal	With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves.
Narration/&Council03_54_Authority_Slang	We got this. Really, it's under control.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default	You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?
Narration/&Council03_56_Greed_Formal	May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?
Narration/&Council03_57_Greed_Slang	We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default	You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance.
Narration/&Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal	We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance.
Narration/&Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang	We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default	We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!
Narration/&Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal	We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown.
Narration/&Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang	Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours.
Narration/&Council03_64_Danantar_NPC	Confidence? I like that.
Narration/&Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC	Preposterous!
Narration/&Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?
Narration/&Council03_67_Authority_Default	Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go.
Narration/&Council03_68_Einarboss_Default	The Soraks will come after you - you know that?
Narration/&Council03_69_Einarboss_Default	But you have our complete support in this struggle.
Narration/&Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal	Our thanks, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal	Thanks.
Narration/&Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC	That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!
Narration/&Council03_74_Danantar_NPC	Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_75_Greed_Default	We're just trying to increase our chance of success.
Narration/&Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC	Of course you are.
Narration/&Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC	We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival.
Narration/&Council03_78_Danantar_NPC	Trust is a hot topic, these days.
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC	Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already.
Narration/&Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC	Yet, we should support you in your efforts.
Narration/&Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC	And we will.
Narration/&Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC	You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?
Narration/&Council03_74_Selfishness_Default	The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else.
Narration/&Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC	Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?
Narration/&Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC	I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership.
Narration/&Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC	If that is all, may we conclude?
Narration/&Council03_78_Princess_NPC	I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate.
Narration/&Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC	Of course, Your Highness. We are listening.
Narration/&Council03_80_Princess_NPC	I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn.
Narration/&Council03_81_Princess_NPC	We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace. 
Narration/&Council03_82_Princess_NPC	They would be safer there, don't you think?
Narration/&Council03_83_Princess_NPC	That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest.
Narration/&Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC	Ahem - Your Highness?
Narration/&Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC	I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval.
Narration/&Council03_86_Princess_NPC	Oh! Right…
Narration/&Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC	Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?
Narration/&Council03_88_Princess_NPC	Of course. I beg the Council's pardon.
Narration/&Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC	Not at all, Your Highness.
Narration/&Council03_90_Danantar_NPC	Then I think that is all?
Narration/&Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC	Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC	A word, please, deputies?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default	Sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal	Of course.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang	What's up?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC	Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default	What's that?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal	I'm not sure what that is.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC	A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default	Sounds nice.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal	It's an honor!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC	You don't say?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default	Where is this residence?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC	In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC	Oh, another thing…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default	Yes?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC	I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default	What's this?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC	A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default	Teleport?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default	We can't do that, I'm pretty sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC	Well, word is that in the Badlands…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC	…you may come across functioning Major Gates.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC	If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC	Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC	…and you'll be able to return there the same way.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default	That's fantastic!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC	Don't get too excited.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC	So far, no one's found any.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default	Oh. Right. Thanks anyway.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC	Stay in the light, senior deputies.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default	You too, Captain.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC	Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default	Fire to your blade!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC	One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC	I am Chaplain Dalon Lark.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC	You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar	That is good to know, Chaplain!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default	Hello!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default	What do you do here?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC	I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC	We provide various services for those who need them.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default	And can pay for them?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC	Those who seek his healing are rarely poor.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default	We do require your services.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default	Thank you - we need to go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC	Stay in the light, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine	We should go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine	We need your services.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Anything new for the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	Check this out!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	Possibly.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang	Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	That's nice of you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Stay in the light!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline	Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer	Let's talk business!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Deputies.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Do you have anything for the Circle?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default	Take a look.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal	We might.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Not really. Just stopped by to say hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default	It's an honor. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Stay in the light, deputies!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Exitline	Just saying hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Offer	What about this?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC	Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC	You have some treasure in your backpacks?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	Feast your eyes on this!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	See what you think of this.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC	Just passing by to say hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC	Ah, well. It was good to see you.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC	See you next time, friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine	Just passing by.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer	What about this?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Deputies! How are you today?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	How 'bout that?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	Indeed.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang	Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Such nice manners! All too rare, these days.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Clear skies to you!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Exitline	Just missed you.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Offer	How about that?
Narration/&Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council4_3_Danantar_NPC	Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?
Narration/&Council4_4_Authority_Normal	We're stuck, my lord.
Narration/&Council4_5_Authority_Formal	My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal.
Narration/&Council4_6_Authority_Slang	It's not good news, my Lord.
Narration/&Council4_7_Faisech_NPC	Meaning what, exactly?
Narration/&Council4_10_Faisech_NPC	Perhaps they've been destroyed.
Narration/&Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC	We tested the first one - it can't be done!
Narration/&Council4_12_Danantar_NPC	They must be magically concealed.
Narration/&Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC	So the Crown must remain incomplete?
Narration/&Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC	Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC	After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_16_Faisech_NPC	If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?
Narration/&Council4_17_Faisech_NPC	It will keep attracting the Soraks.
Narration/&Council4_18_Danantar_NPC	The attunement, remember?
Narration/&Council4_19_Faisech_NPC	I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement…
Narration/&Council4_20_Faisech_NPC	…I believe the Crown should be secured…
Narration/&Council4_21_Faisech_NPC	…and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!
Narration/&Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC	We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!
Narration/&Council4_23_Faisech_NPC	Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!
Narration/&Council4_24_Faisech_NPC	You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!
Narration/&Council4_25_Authority_Normal	We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk.
Narration/&Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal	We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_27_Danantar_NPC	If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation.
Narration/&Council4_28_Faisech_NPC	More time? How much time?
Narration/&Council4_29_Danantar_NPC	Maybe just… give it a night.
Narration/&Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC	I could use the day to consult with my people.
Narration/&Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC	So could I.
Narration/&Council4_32_Danantar_NPC	Fine, then! Anyone against?
Narration/&Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC	Thank you, Lord Danantar.
Narration/&Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC	The Legacy Council is now adjourned!
Narration/&Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal	I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal	I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!
Narration/&Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang	Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs… doesn't matter if I die!
Narration/&Council4_38_Authority_Normal	This is wrong.
Narration/&Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal	We could run.
Narration/&Council4_40_Authority_Normal	What's the point? We know what's at stake.
Narration/&Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal	They're right about one thing.
Narration/&Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal	The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_43_Authority_Normal	We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked.
Narration/&Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal	There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!
Narration/&Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Excuse me, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council4_46_Highclass_Formal	Master Surespell.
Narration/&Council4_47_Any_Normal	Clear skies, Heddlon.
Narration/&Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight.
Narration/&Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal	What? Why?
Narration/&Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I'm not at liberty to say… just trust me.
Narration/&Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there.
Narration/&Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal	What kind of advice is that?
Narration/&Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal	You must realize your suggestion is… unusual. Suspicious, even.
Narration/&Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang	Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?
Narration/&Council4_55_Nosy_Normal	Are you really working for the Arcaneum? 
Narration/&Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Why else would I be here?
Narration/&Council4_57_Mean_Normal	This elf is…
Narration/&Council4_58_Lawful_Normal	What do you think?
Narration/&Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal	It sounds like a warning.
Narration/&Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal	Or a threat!
Narration/&Council4_61_Lawful_Normal	Can we trust him?
Narration/&Council4_62_Carver_Normal	Trust the New Empire?
Narration/&Council4_63_Greed_Normal	I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight.
Narration/&Council4_64_Cynical_Normal	I miss Karel's beer.
Narration/&Council4_65_Any4_Normal	And Merton's sweet talk.
Narration/&Council4_66_Cynical_Normal	I'd prefer the residence.
Narration/&Council4_67_Cynical_Normal	I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight.
Narration/&Council4_68_Authority_Normal	Maybe in your dreams.
Narration/&NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default	Soraks - here?
Narration/&NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang	Soraks! Right here in our damn room!
Narration/&NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal	The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!
Narration/&NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default	We were warned.
Narration/&NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default	Surespell? How did he know?
Narration/&NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default	Why would he know what the Soraks would do?
Narration/&NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default	He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do.
Narration/&NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang	He tried to save our hides, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal	His warning might have saved us all, mind you.
Narration/&NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal	He just wants us to think he's a friend.
Narration/&NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal	It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust.
Narration/&NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default	Too far-fetched.
Narration/&NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default	So what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang	What's the plan, then?
Narration/&NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal	Be that as it may, what shall we do now?
Narration/&NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal	Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal	We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default	Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal	Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal	Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang	That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful.
Narration/&NightAttack2_6_Any_Default	How did you know?
Narration/&NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Call it a hunch. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang	A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?
Narration/&NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal	Oh, really?
Narration/&NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal	You can't expect us to believe that?
Narration/&NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Oh, I have friends who… gather information.
Narration/&NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share.
Narration/&NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal	It felt real enough to us, too.
Narration/&NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal	Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain.
Narration/&NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default	You know more than you're telling.
Narration/&NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters.
Narration/&NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal	Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?
Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal	In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?
Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul.
Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal	Seriously? Everyone knows that!
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal	That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	But clearly you're here for business, not small talk.
Narration/&NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal	Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal	Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang	That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Not at all, since you followed my… advice.
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Default	How do you know that?
Narration/&NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	You're here, alive and unwounded.
Narration/&NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I heard there was some disturbance at the residence.
Narration/&NightAttack4_7_Any_Default	Is that so?
Narration/&NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Senior deputies!
Narration/&NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default	Captain! What's the news?
Narration/&NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC	You didn't hear?
Narration/&NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!
Narration/&NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default	What? When?
Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC	During the night. It's lucky you weren't there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal	Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two.
Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal	No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC	They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected.
Narration/&NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default	Who, then?
Narration/&NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC	I can't say for sure but…
Narration/&NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Some are saying… Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal	That's a worrying prospect, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang	So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!
Narration/&NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal	We were supposed to be safe there, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC	I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place.
Narration/&NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default	Good to know.
Narration/&NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal	Thanks for the heads-up, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal	Thank you for keeping us informed, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC	You are most welcome.
Narration/&NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Good day to you, senior deputies.
Narration/&NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal	So he told the truth, that Heddlon.
Narration/&NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal	It appears Heddlon Surespell was right.
Narration/&NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default	He knew, but how?
Narration/&NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal	He's a spy, or something similar.
Narration/&NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal	I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence.
Narration/&NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang	The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face.
Narration/&NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default	He looks normal to me.
Narration/&NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default	That's what spies do. 
Narration/&NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default	So, what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang	So - now what?
Narration/&NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal	We must decide on our next move.
Narration/&NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal	Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal	We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default	Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC	Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor.
Narration/&Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC	Thank you, Protector.
Narration/&Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC	Honorable Council members, we at the Guild of Antiquarians have come to an agreement…
Narration/&Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC	…regarding the quest for the gems of the Crown of the Magister.
Narration/&Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC	We believe that the Crown should be secured, and therefore surrendered by its current owners…
Narration/&Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC	…in exchange for a generous payment…
Narration/&Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC	…raised by all parties in the Council.
Narration/&Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default	You can't!
Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC	You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!
Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default	We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?
Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC	Order!
Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC	We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them.
Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC	Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply…
Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC	…for the security of all.
Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default	Security? You talk of security?
Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default	What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!
Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC	What?
Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC	Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&Council5_21_Danantar_NPC	In the palace?
Narration/&Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC	Order!
Narration/&Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC	Immediate action is needed!
Narration/&Council5_24_Danantar_NPC	Well, find the damned Soraks, then!
Narration/&Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC	Please, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_26_Danantar_NPC	Where are your paladins?
Narration/&Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC	Where are your wizards and their divination spells?
Narration/&Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC	Stop it!
Narration/&Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC	None of this is helping!
Narration/&Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC	Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral here!
Narration/&Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC	Someone must introduce a formal request.
Narration/&Council5_32_Danantar_NPC	Right. Apologies.
Narration/&Council5_33_Danantar_NPC	You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please.
Narration/&Council5_34_Danantar_NPC	Those for securing the Crown, say aye.
Narration/&Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_36_Faisech_NPC	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_37_Danantar_NPC	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_38_Keenmind_Default	…nay.
Narration/&Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC	Nay.
Narration/&Council5_40_Danantar_NPC	Well, we have a majority.
Narration/&Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC	We'll help you with the… attunement issue.
Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC	Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?
Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC	Well, the most secure location would be…
Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC	…the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth.
Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC	Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!
Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC	Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!
Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC	Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC	We have secure locations, too!
Narration/&Council5_49_Danantar_NPC	How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_50_Faisech_NPC	More than actual wizards in your school!
Narration/&Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC	Order!
Narration/&Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC	Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC	Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken.
Narration/&Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	This is a mistake.
Narration/&Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN	You're all stupid!
Narration/&Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN	We must obey the Council…
Narration/&Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Someone here is a traitor!
Narration/&Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default	This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC	You are sworn deputies. You must comply.
Narration/&Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default	The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!
Narration/&Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC	Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders.
Narration/&Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default	We serve the Council.
Narration/&Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC	And you shall be commended, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default	You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!
Narration/&Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC	This is a grave accusation, senior deputy.
Narration/&Council5_66_Authority_Default	How could they?
Narration/&Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default	It can't end like this!
Narration/&Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default	I can hear it calling!
Narration/&Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC	Senior deputies, please, a word?
Narration/&Council5_70_Authority_Default	Summer? What do you want? 
Narration/&Council5_71_Authority_Default	Your chancellor led the charge against us in there.
Narration/&Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC	I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you.
Narration/&Council5_73_Selfpres_Default	I doubt it.
Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC	It's about the secret cult of Arivad.
Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default	What?
Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC	I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still…
Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default	Speak up.
Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC	One of my people saw a man with a tattoo…
Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default	The letter A?
Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC	Yes. He followed the man all day, and to a gathering that night…
Narration/&Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC	…in a remote village to the south.
Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default	What village?
Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC	It's called Earcorn. Very small…
Narration/&Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC	…but you'll find it easily on any local map.
Narration/&Council5_85_Friendly_Default	Thank you, Halman.
Narration/&Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC	You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists.
Narration/&Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC	And the Council… well, you know.
Narration/&Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default	Yes, we do.
Narration/&Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC	I'm so sorry.
Narration/&Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default	Why? You didn't betray us.
Narration/&Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC	I understand how they see things, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal	Something's wrong with the Council.
Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang	The Council's rotten.
Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC	The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…
Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC	…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies.
Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default	Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you.
Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default	Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?
Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC	Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans.
Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC	It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience.
Narration/&Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC	I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now. 
Narration/&Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC	It didn't change anything, anyway.
Narration/&Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC	But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?
Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default	Better than I expected.
Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default	Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default	Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default	…the voice is still calling.
Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC	Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?
Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any	Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?
Narration/&Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC	You have my word.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC	Hey, you!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default	Not drowning in your beer today, Arwin?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC	No, wait!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC	They took the Crown from you?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default	How do you know that?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC	How? You really think I'm just a drunk?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC	The whole Principality knows you have that Crown.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC	I mean had.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal	Yeah.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal	Indeed.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC	Something's not right.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal	You think we need you to tell us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC	I mean something's up - something big.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal	What, exactly?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC	They're here.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default	Who? The Soraks?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC	Not them. Their pawns.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default	You're drunk.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC	What's wrong with you? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC	Haven't you seen enough?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC	Didn't you see what they can do? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC	To people?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC	At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys…
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC	…but you've seen their ways.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC	At Coparann, and plenty other places, I'm sure.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC	The way they get into people's heads.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC	I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC	I've felt a change - slow, subtle…
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC	…until now. It's getting stronger!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC	I can't let them win.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default	So what? You're ready to become a hero again?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC	I can still fight.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default	Are you offering to join us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC	You brought back my sword.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC	That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC	You helped me get closure for my lost child.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC	You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC	Yes, I'd like to join you.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN	Fine.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN	No.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default	Fine, come with us.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default	You're useless!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton	And you're stupid!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton	Ha ha! Now you're talking!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default	This is it? Earcorn!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC	Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal	This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang	Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal	Not exactly how I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default	But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default	Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal	Let's look around for anything suspicious.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal	Let us examine the area in search of clues.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default	No tavern? That's suspicious for a start.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC	That was my line!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang	Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal	You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format	Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default	I have something!
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default	Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default	Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC	Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default	Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default	Soraks?
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default	This is it! Be ready for anything.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default	That didn't feel like we surprised them.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default	Because we didn't.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default	This was a trap.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC	Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default	Halman Summer?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default	He said the intelligence wasn't certain.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC	The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default	He's a traitor!
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default	A Sorak in disguise?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default	Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC	Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default	Anyone checked him for a tattoo?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default	There's only one way to know for sure.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default	Let's go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal	What is all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default	Is that the army? In the city?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default	Let's find Summer!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default	I'd prefer to find Carran first.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC	I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default	Check on who?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default	I thought he had no friends left.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default	His brewer, maybe?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal	Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang	Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal	Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC	Not since the conscription.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default	Conscription? Is that what's happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC	I know, it's been in the air, but now…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC	…rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default	Gallivan? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC	Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default	Robar? You've been drafted?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC	Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default	Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC	I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC	Is war really better?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default	Can't disagree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC	Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC	If you say so.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC	Be safe, Robar.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default	To the bitter end, brother.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default	To the bitter end.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default	You, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC	Beryl? What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default	Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC	You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default	What mess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC	War. Or the threat of war.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default	We didn't do anything!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC	Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC	We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default	How about maintaining peace?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC	I did my part. Didn't work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default	When are you leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC	As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC	Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC	Farewell, Beryl.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default	Good luck, my lady.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC	Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default	Daliat! What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC	Well, I'd rather not say.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default	Always secretive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default	Do we still need to play this game?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Oh, hello.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default	Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default	Are you two related?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC	He's my superior.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Two ranks above.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default	Right.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC	So, you two are spies?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default	Such a crude word.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC	We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default	The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC	Nicer than 'spies.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default	So, what's in there?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Nothing and no one, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I was looking for your… acquaintance, Halman Summer.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default	Oh, him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default	We were looking for him, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I'm afraid he's gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default	Isn't everybody leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	The Antiquarians are still packing up, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default	He sent after a lead…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default	…or rather, into a trap.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	I'm not surprised.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	We had eyes on him, but… we lost him.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default	Is he that good?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Or he had help. Magical.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC	Soraks?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Who knows?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC	What triggered all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	You should really get to the Council.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	They'll tell you everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC	In Maraike's name! You're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default	What is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC	The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default	Poisoned? How many died?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC	All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC	After Dean Faisech accused the Council of… favoritism toward the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC	…for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default	At the Temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC	I know that, of course.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC	Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC	Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default	But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC	You think I don't know that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC	This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default	So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC	No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default	And it failed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC	We're not at war yet.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default	But Gallivan's massing troops at the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC	Bad news really does travel fast.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC	Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to… intervene.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default	Her? How?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC	Not as a member of the Council. As head of state.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC	But tell me, where were you now that your quest is… well…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default	Chasing the Soraks and their pawns.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default	Unsuccessfully.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default	Halman Summer might have been one of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC	What? The man was… I mean, I dined at his mansion recently… he…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default	Where?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC	Where what?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default	A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC	No - his family has a mansion in town.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC	Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default	We need to go there.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC	I might need you when you're done with this errand.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal	Is that it?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal	Is this the place?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal	I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal	Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal	Not bad for a secret home.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang	He's no dummy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal	And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal	Hiding in plain sight - classic.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default	Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default	We should obtain a warrant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default	We're past that, don't you think?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default	Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default	Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal	This place is… insane.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal	Truly, a den of madness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default	Holy Maraike…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default	Einar protect us all…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default	In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default	Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default	In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they…?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default	Dissimulation is their creed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default	This ends now. Let's kill them all!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default	Maybe they have the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal	Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal	I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal	They're all from town!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal	Corrupted by the Soraks!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal	For years, maybe. They were preparing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal	There's a ton of paperwork here.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal	A lot's been burned, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal	No sign of the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal	Look at this - a map of the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal	What are these places?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal	Everywhere we've been… and some other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal	The gems… all eight of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal	And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal	Probably the location of the Rift.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal	It's in the Aer Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal	And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal	No idea.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal	Not a dwarf rune.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal	I have a list of names.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal	Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal	There's a whole book of names here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal	We must take this to the authorities!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal	There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal	War is coming whatever we do.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal	Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal	Lord Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC	This isn't a good time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal	We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal	Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC	Surely you exaggerate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal	Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC	What? Where did you find this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal	Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC	I can't believe it… all this time…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal	There's more!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal	Everything suggests that the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal	They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC	Maraike's mercy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC	We must convene the Council, but… this really isn't the best time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal	The Gallivan situation, I suppose?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang	Gallivan, eh? How is it going?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC	All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default	More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC	We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default	What?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC	The envoy from Gallivan was… adamant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC	The Princess took command of the situation…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC	…and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default	So why the troops at the border?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC	Let's call it… an incentive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default	Everything should be fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default	The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC	Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC	Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default	So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC	To defend the city. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC	The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default	So much for confidence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC	Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default	So you're resurrecting Faisech?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default	How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC	I know what you're going to say. So don't.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default	And someone must pray for his soul… Imagine that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC	Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default	Wait a minute!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default	Where is this happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC	In the Temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC	Wait, you don't… they died!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default	You think they'd stop at that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC	Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC	More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC	…close to the Crown of the Magister?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC	No! No, no, no!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC	What are we waiting for?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default	Marshal!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC	Greetings, friends!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default	Where are the delegates?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC	In the dispensary.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default	Are you all right?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC	I just cast a resurrection spell… forgive me - it is rather draining.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC	Wait!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal	Feeling good, dead people?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal	All right, everyone, we know who you are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC	Attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC	By Einar… Sorak agents, in the temple!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default	Where's the Crown?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC	Take this key. I… can't run.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC	Follow the light!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default	Let's go!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default	There!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default	It's gone!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default	Here! A secret passage?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default	In the middle of the temple?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default	How did they miss that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default	Doesn't matter now!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default	This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default	No time for a history lesson!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default	They went this way!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default	The city's Imperial Gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default	They're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default	They're trying to get away with the Crown!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default	Protector!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC	We failed! They got away with it!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default	No!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC	They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default	It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC	There's too many of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC	Come on! Fight!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default	Look!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default	The Princess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC	Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC	One day, Arwin Merton…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC	Don't look at me like that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default	Your Royal Highness…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC	…thank you is what you're looking for.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default	Thank you.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default	They took the Crown.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC	Is this… evil god coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default	I suppose that's their plan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default	Can we follow them? 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default	There's no way to know where they've gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default	There are so many gates.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default	Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default	No one knows exactly where the Rift was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC	In the Aer Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default	They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default	So we're doomed?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC	We're under attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC	Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default	Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default	Your Royal Highness…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default	We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default	Do you have any ideas?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC	This is Sunset Peak, south of Aer Elai. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC	I recognize this tower… or what's left of it.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC	There is a gate not too far away.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC	But who knows how the place looks like now?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default	We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default	They don't stand a chance against you!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC	Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default	What? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC	Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC	There's no time to explain - you have to trust me.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC	Only you can save Solasta now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default	Us? What about all your… heroes, and all?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC	Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default	Oh… they planned this as well, didn't they?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC	All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC	Protector Kean is not what she used to be.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default	Merton? You coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC	He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC	The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC	Kaseinax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default	The Magister? You knew him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC	You're too curious for your own good.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default	So, Merton's staying.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC	Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default	Fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC	I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC	And my blessing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default	My arm is yours, Princess.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default	Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default	You're definitely the best crowned head around.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default	To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default	That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default	We will prevail or die, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default	So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default	Einar will be with us, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default	Maraike will be with us in life and death.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default	May Arun guide us all.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default	Justice will be served, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC	You should rest and prepare yourselves.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default	Sleep, now? There's no time!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC	You really should start admitting that you don't know everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC	Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC	I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC	When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default	Did she just… stop time?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default	This is unnatural.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default	I won't be able to sleep now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default	You know what's at stake. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default	We'll need to be ready for anything.
Narration/&Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC	Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC	It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently...
Narration/&Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC	Didn't see a difference.
Narration/&Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal	Nice to meet you, too.
Narration/&Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal	And who might you be, lady?
Narration/&Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC	Call me Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal	That's a peculiar name.
Narration/&Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal	So that's not your real name?
Narration/&Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC	It's the only name I need.
Narration/&Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC	Tell me something.
Narration/&Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC	You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?
Narration/&Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal	I knew these badges would help eventually.
Narration/&Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal	Yes, we are. Interested in joining?
Narration/&Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC	Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal	We met him.
Narration/&Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC	If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC	A message, and a gift.
Narration/&Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal	Why not go yourself?
Narration/&Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC	I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me.
Narration/&Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal	A personal matter?
Narration/&Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang	He cheated on you or something?
Narration/&Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal	Sounds like a sensitive topic.
Narration/&Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC	I'd rather not go into detail. 
Narration/&Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang	What's the gift?
Narration/&Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal	What do we need to take back?
Narration/&Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC	A longsword.
Narration/&Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal	Not too heavy. We could do that.
Narration/&Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal	But what's the reward?
Narration/&Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC	Ah - real heroes!
Narration/&Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC	I can give you the location of a... treasure.
Narration/&Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal	Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case...
Narration/&Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC	It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC	The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2	Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal	Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside.
Narration/&Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC	But it's full of monsters. Too many for me.
Narration/&Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal	We could team up.
Narration/&Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC	I've... lost the taste for adventuring.
Narration/&Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC	Do we have a deal?
Narration/&Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC	Sure.
Narration/&Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC	Not interested.
Narration/&Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC	Fine, what's the message?
Narration/&Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse	Sorry. We have more important things to do.
Narration/&Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept	As you wish.
Narration/&Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC	Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife45_Any_Normal	All right... we'll tell him that.
Narration/&Mertonswife46_Any_Formal	Fine, we'll take your message to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC	Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map.
Narration/&Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal	Farewell, Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal	Hello, Arwin.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC	Arwin? We're friends now? 
Narration/&Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC	I'll keep calling you kid, I think.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal	Whatever.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal	Suit yourself.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal	We've been to Coparann - ring a bell?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal	I suppose you know the name Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC	You bet.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal	Apparently, you are indebted to someone there.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal	An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC	Really?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal	Something to do with her mood, maybe.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal	She said you owe her… a child.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC	She's crazy.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal	We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC	Yeah… thanks for the message.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal	Want to tell us what this is about?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal	Maybe you would like to share a story with us?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC	No. I don't.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal	You didn't take her child away from her?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC	You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal	All right. It's none of our business.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal	She gave us this for you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC	What?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC	I don't believe it!
Narration/&Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC	She went back for it…
Narration/&Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal	Feel more like talking now?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC	Get out!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC	Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default	We're getting by.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default	Did you hear about a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC	Sure - if you're ready to die!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default	We're not green anymore, Merton.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC	Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC	I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC	At first I tried to help. No one ever came back.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC	So I decided to stop talking about it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC	I felt… well…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default	Responsible for their deaths?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC	Responsible? No - they paid for their folly.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC	I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default	Are we bothering you?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC	You're always bothering me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default	Let's go.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC	Oh, don't be so sensitive!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC	All right - the temple is real. I've seen it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default	You have?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC	It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default	And you didn't raid it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC	Well, ten of us found the place…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC	…when I was the only one left, I came home.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default	The other nine died?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC	Slaughtered. All of them.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC	Still interested?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default	You think we're not strong enough?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC	I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC	…maybe with me… you'd have a chance.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default	You'd come with us?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC	I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC	You'd never find it, for a start.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default	Are you after the treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC	Who says there's any treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC	There's a monster - I know that.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC	What is it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC	That, I don't know.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC	I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default	Fair enough.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC	It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC	I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default	Sure.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal	We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC	Good for you!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal	Did you change your mind?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC	No, no. I'm ready!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC	Let's go!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal	Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC	Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparann first.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal	Oh - unfinished business, maybe?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC	You know exactly what business.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal	So how about the quest?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC	Your map has a location called Caer Elis.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal	It's just an old Manacalon name.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC	Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC	I'll be waiting for you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal	What if we don't come?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC	Then damn the lot of you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal	What we get there before you do?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC	Ha, ha! As if you could!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC	See you there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal	He's crazy. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal	And we're going with him.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC	See? I told you I'd be here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal	What have you been doing?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC	Catching up with wildlife.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC	It used to be my thing.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal	Camping in the Badlands? Really?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC	Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal	Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC	Behind the mist.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal	We're through the mist!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC	Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal	Einar will guide us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal	Maraike is with us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal	Pakri will clear our minds.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal	Arun will guide our hearts.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal	No pain, no gain.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal	Thanks for the encouragement.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC	Just saying…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal	We did it!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC	Yeah, we did!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC	There's still the big one, in there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal	Sure. It's not over yet.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal	This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal	Was there really a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal	I think I know what this was:
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal	A temple of Arivad!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal	Einar protect us!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal	Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal	Not before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal	Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal	Before he was corrupted. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal	His good side became Einar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal	His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal	The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is… evil.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal	This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal	Whatever took place within these walls happened a millennium ago.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal	Such evil never fully disappears.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal	Well, then - let's clean the place up!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC	Well, I must say…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC	You're the best team I ever had.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal	Thanks!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal	From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC	Now, it's time to take your reward.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal	You're leaving?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC	I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC	I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal	Mysterious.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal	Crazy but… a damn good ranger.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal	He's going back to that Bitterroot woman.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal	That's none of our business. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal	Indeed. That chest on the other hand…
Narration/&TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default	Look at that…
Narration/&TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default	…the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default	There's nothing left of the Old Empire.
Narration/&TheAerElai4_Authority_Default	All right, people - we're not here for the view.
Narration/&TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default	This wind… it's not natural.
Narration/&TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default	It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across.
Narration/&TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default	So, falling would be a bad idea, then.
Narration/&TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default	We've been through worse.
Narration/&TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default	Watch out!
Narration/&TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default	What kind of creature lives in a place like this?
Narration/&TheAerElai11_Nature_Default	You got it: fire spiders.
Narration/&TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default	Over there! Soraks!
Narration/&TheAerElai13_Einar_Default	They don't need to hide here.
Narration/&TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default	They're not paying attention. What are they doing?
Narration/&TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default	Dropping gigantic bones into lava?
Narration/&TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default	Why?
Narration/&TheAerElai17_Nature_Default	They're not just any bones…
Narration/&TheAerElai18_Nature_Default	…those are dragon bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default	How many dragons died here?
Narration/&TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default	Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them.
Narration/&TheAerElai21_Authority_Default	There's no other way - we need to get up there!
Narration/&TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default	Without being shot at, preferably?
Narration/&TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default	More dragon bones?
Narration/&TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default	That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!
Narration/&TheAerElai25_Authority_Default	They were destroying the bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default	How do you know?
Narration/&TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default	The bones are a threat to them!
Narration/&TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default	I don't follow.
Narration/&TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default	These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default	Dragons? All of them?
Narration/&TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default	The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons.
Narration/&TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default	Even the Magister.
Narration/&TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default	And his bones are among those.
Narration/&TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default	I thought I felt something, but…
Narration/&TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default	Definitely.
Narration/&TheAerElai36_Authority_Default	We need to search the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai37_Any_Default	Here!
Narration/&TheAerElai38_Any2_Default	A tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai39_Any3_Default	It calls to me…
Narration/&TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC	Let me… touch my Crown…
Narration/&TheAerElai41_Any_Default	Did you hear that?
Narration/&TheAerElai42_Any2_Default	I did.
Narration/&TheAerElai43_Any3_Default	He wants to touch the Crown.
Narration/&TheAerElai44_Any4_Default	The tooth? Just one little tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai45_Any3_Default	That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai46_Any2_Default	What will happen if we succeed?
Narration/&TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC	Let me… touch my Crown…
Narration/&TheAerElai48_Authority_Default	There's only one way to find out.
Narration/&TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default	This place never ends!
Narration/&TheAerElai50_Any2_Default	This is the way - I can hear the Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai51_Any3_Default	Yes! We must go on!
Narration/&TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default	Are we walking into some gigantic trap?
Narration/&TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default	The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!
Narration/&TheAerElai54_Authority_Default	Come on - don't falter now!
Narration/&TheAerElai55_Any_Default	This is it - the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default	Is it open again?
Narration/&TheAerElai57_Any_Default	Hard to say. 
Narration/&TheAerElai58_Any_Default	I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting.
Narration/&TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default	And no god.
Narration/&TheAerElai60_Any_Default	The Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai61_Any_Default	They're doing it - the damn ritual!
Narration/&TheAerElai62_Any_Default	This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die.
Narration/&TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default	Einar guide us!
Narration/&TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default	Maraike watch over us!
Narration/&TheAerElai65_AcolyteArun_Default	Arun lights our way!
Narration/&TheAerElai66_AcolytePakri_Default	Justice will prevail!
Narration/&TheAerElai67_Highclass_Default	For all my ancestors, I shall not fail!
Narration/&TheAerElai68_Sellsword_Default	To the bitter end!
Narration/&TheAerElai69_Lowlife_Default	Let's make this bitch pay once and for all.
Narration/&TheAerElai70_Spy_Default	Let's neutralize this guy.
Narration/&TheAerElai71_Academic_Default	If we were destined to fail, we would have perished already.
Narration/&TheAerElai72_Philosopher_Default	We'll venture where no one has been before!
Narration/&TheAerElai73_Lawmaker_Default	This chaos will end - today!
Narration/&TheAerElai74_Any_Default	We did it!
Narration/&TheAerElai75_Any2_Default	The Magister!
Narration/&TheAerElai76_Any2_Default	He's coming back to life!
Narration/&TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC	Hold.
Narration/&TheAerElai78_Any3_Default	What?
Narration/&TheAerElai79_Any4_Default	The Rift, it's open!
Narration/&TheAerElai80_Any3_Default	No! 
Narration/&TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC	HOLD.
Narration/&TheAerElai82_Any_Default	I thought that was it!
Narration/&TheAerElai83_Any2_Default	He said hold! We need to hold!
Narration/&TheAerElai84_Any_Default	Against a whole army?
Narration/&TheAerElai85_Any3_Default	Look!
Narration/&TheAerElai86_Any3_Default	He's closing the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai87_Authority_Default	Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!
Narration/&TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC	I was right about you.
Narration/&TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC	I must go, now.
Narration/&TheAerElai90_Magister_NPC	Take care of Solasta. Take care of your world.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default	Hello Annie.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC	You're back! How did it go?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default	Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC	Oh. Who's in charge, then?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default	You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC	I see.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC	Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default	You're welcome.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default	We wanted to talk about Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC	I'm all ears.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default	No one's there anymore…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC	Ah, you want to claim the place?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default	How does it work again?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC	We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default	We can't promise you it's safe.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC	It never is.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC	Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC	I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default	What do we do next?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC	Once we've done our work, I'll let you know.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC	You'll just have to come by and collect your share.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01	I think… this is what the Crown showed me.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02	So, not one of the gems?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03	Obviously.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04	Do you feel anything else?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05	Yes.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06	Alright - let's go, then.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07	I'm afraid not.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08	That's a problem.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09	Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC	I have great need of you, my friends.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default	What's going on?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC	One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default	Oh, where?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC	It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC	They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC	No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC	So they started exploring.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC	One of them came back yesterday...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC	...he had lost an arm.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC	He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC	Alas, Telema is many days from here.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default	Do you think they're still alive?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC	I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC	If they're alive, bring them back.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC	If not... I'll send for their bodies.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC	Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default	Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC	That would make you part of the family, I promise.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default	All right, let's hope we find them alive.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default	Good old Hector, eh?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default	Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default	Soraks?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default	At least we saved two of them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default	The best ones, I'm sure.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default	Shut up!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default	Let's go back and tell Annie.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC	My friends, you did it!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default	Lena and Dek are already here?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC	I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default	So they told you about Hector.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC	Yes. Another friend lost...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default	You mean Arwin Merton?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC	Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default	Actually, we found proof that it was.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC	Oh... and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default	We must go, Annie. See you!
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default	Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC	You could say that.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC	Not boss of much, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC	We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default	One?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC	She's around somewhere. You might run into her.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default	We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC	Yeah?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC	Tell me where. We'll take care of it.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC	The law provides, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri2_Pakri_Default	Pakri preserve us!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri4_Priestess_NPC	May the owl watch over you, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri3_Priestess_NPC	May you find the answers you seek, adventurers.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike1_Priest_NPC	There's life yet, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike2_Maraike_Default	Maraike smile on you!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike3_Priest_NPC	Lady of life! A follower of the goddess.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC	Walk in life, adventurers.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Ah - deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default	Clear skies, lady mayor!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC	I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default	Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default	Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default	Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC	You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default	A companion of the third enlightenment!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default	Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Ah yes, this matter for the Council! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default	What matter? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default	A weighty matter indeed!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	I am cleared to hear everything! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default	Well… it all began at Caer Lem…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal	Clear skies, master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Clear skies to you!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal	Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC	Yes, indeed! I would like more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC	…details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal	Certainly. How goes your research?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC	You gave me much to consider. But I need more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC	…hence this invitation
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC	There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC	Did you witness it first hand?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal	Alas, quite often! When they fight…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal	They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC	But why, why so much suffering? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal	We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC	He expects them to spread terror…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal	…so he can influence and…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal	…pervert humans… control them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC	Humans, you say? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal	Yes - others seem less susceptible…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal	… from what we understand of them!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC	And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal	To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC	Fascinating…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal	Does it help?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC	Oh, yes, very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC	Thank you very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal	Until next time, then, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default	Clear skies, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC	Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC	We live in fascinating times!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default	Too true!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC	So, about our last meeting… 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default	Still troubled, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC	Yes, indeed.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC	I have had occasion to witness… certain things.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default	What things?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC	I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC	…they reminded me of what you said.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC	About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default	Master! You're scaring me, now!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC	I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default	Of course!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default	You realize something very bad might be happening to him?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default	I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default	Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC	Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default	Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC	Clear skies, senior deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default	Why do you call us that? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC	Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default	I knew there was some treachery afoot here!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default	What?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default	You'd better explain yourself quickly!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC	I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default	They're here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC	I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC	But instead, he changed me!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC	He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good. 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC	And I won't let any harm come to him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default	How can we believe you?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC	I am not the danger! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC	The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default	And?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC	I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default	What do you want? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC	Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC	We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC	The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC	I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC	…and Galeafin must disappear to be safe.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default	Do you truly want to leave, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC	Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default	Very well, we shall come when you send for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default	Is it time?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default	And once inside?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC	Wait for my signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC	And until then, let me speak.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC	State your business!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC	Glory of souls!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC	Power to the One!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC	We're running late! Are we the last?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC	Yes! All are awaiting your guest.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC	New recruits.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC	It's one at a time, you know the rules!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC	Indeed, I know them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER	Follow me to the basement.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER	Let me guess - that was the signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default	Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default	Or scared to death!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default	Where's Illoreth?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default	I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default	Farewell, Master.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default	May your wisdom serve you well, now.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default	What's this? A shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default	Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default	That someone ruined their own shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default	Maybe it was just the cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default	There's a small chest, here.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default	Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC	Clear skies! Yes, thank you for coming so fast.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC	Remember that monastery near Coparann?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default	The Tirmarian ruins? Of course.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC	There was a cemetery there.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default	Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to meet you about it.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC	I shall go to him right away! Clear skies! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default	Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC	Clear skies! Einar guards you all! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC	Ah, there you are!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default	Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC	Many thanks for coming! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC	It's about the Sunblaze Monastery.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default	We're all ears!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC	The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default	And?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC	Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC	He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC	The heads of the Church searched for him for years.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC	Then he was considered to be lost, either left on the home world…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC	…or killed in the Cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC	Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default	A sad tale, for sure.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC	Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC	I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default	A sign?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC	Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC	He might have cursed his own symbol.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC	The souls of his brothers too, wander, somewhere in this land.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC	Someone needs to go and cleanse their remains with holy water.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default	Will that suffice?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC	Not if Emtan is indeed cursed, his soul will be too angry.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC	Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default	And if he doesn't listen to reason? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC	Then - and only then - should you destroy him. 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default	We will do what is necessary.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC	May Arun's fire warm your heart! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default	Clear skies!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default	Did we forget to close the door on our last visit? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default	Never opened it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default	Well, someone's dropped by!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default	Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default	Not many remains left for the prayer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default	You had to say it! Get ready, people!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default	We're not going to try talking to them first? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default	Zombies don't talk!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default	No harm in trying, I guess.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default	May the light of the gods free your souls!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default	Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC	Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default	A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC	There are no gods in this place, fool! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default	Do you truly believe that? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC	Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default	Did they not? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC	I prayed and never got an answer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default	Yes, it did!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC	Liar!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default	Did you not have water and the means to grow food?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC	Barely!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default	Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC	We heard them roam at night! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default	Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC	What?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default	And yet you survived how many years here? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC	But my prayers weren't answered!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default	Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default	Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC	It won't work, you fool!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC	Arun! The lord is still here!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default	It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC	Thank you…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal	Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC	Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default	Yes, all of them are with the gods now! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC	And Emtan?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal	Saved. He is with Arun.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC	Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC	Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed	We couldn't bring him back. He's gone.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC	You? I know you!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default	What?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC	You were at the embassy! An aide or something… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default	You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC	You can't fool me, I never forget a face.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default	What's going on, friend?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default	Never mind.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC	That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default	Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default	He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC	This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default	Anything we should know?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default	Old story.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default	Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default	I agree.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default	All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC	Who goes there?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default	I'd like to see Ambassador Crawley.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC	Council business?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default	Inaudible
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC	Follow me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default	Just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default	Shut up and follow.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC	I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default	Nice to see you, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC	Can't say I expected your visit.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default	I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC	And?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default	He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC	Seems to?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default	He's pretty eager to pin it on me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC	We can't let that happen.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default	That's why I'm here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC	Them?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default	Friends. Trustworthy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC	You have to take him out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC	I can suggest a course of action.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC	You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default	Oh, is that all?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC	Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default	I might.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC	Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default	It looks like you have this all figured out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC	I always plan for every contingency.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC	We should go.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC	Then this time it's farewell for good.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default	You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default	This is crazy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives	We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal	That's not an embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal	Just not its best side.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang	Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang	Mind your own business. This way. Stay low.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal	Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal	This is it.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal	Let's hope this works.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang	Let's get out of here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC	Greetings, colleague.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default	I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC	Sure. What can I do for you?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default	You know Lord Belmont?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC	Ambassador Belmont? Of course.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default	We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC	Nice. What's the catch?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default	I need you to release it right away.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC	Right now? No long-term leverage?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default	That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC	I'll need you to do something for me, then.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default	I'm listening.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC	Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC	I need them dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default	We're not murderers.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC	They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default	Enough to die, just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default	Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default	Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default	Hey! Any news?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC	It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default	Good! I knew I could depend on you.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC	That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC	Pleasure working with you, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default	See you, Daliat.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default	Is Lord Belmont around?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC	He had to… return home.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default	In a rush?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC	Indeed.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default	Thank you, Ravensworth.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC	Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal	That'd be me. Who wrote me?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC	Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal	Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal	Clear skies! What's it all about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	What events?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Their deaths?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal	A house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	They were shrewd and successful. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	So the house belongs to you now, I guess! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal	What events? What are you talking about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal	How did they die?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	They died right after the siege. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword	After? Not during? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	No… I… How can I put this?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success	They were… responsible. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail	Come on - spit it out!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword	What? No! How? Who said? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	That's the hardest part.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword	What do you mean?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword	What? Me? How?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword	How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword	Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword	I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword	What does that mean, "resist temptation"? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success	Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure	Bribery?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword	It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_1_Sellsword_Slang	Clear skies to you, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal	I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal	Thanks, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang	Clear skies, Master Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_2_AlanMiller_NPC	Clear skies! What can I do for you? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_3_Sellsword_Normal	Here - from Sergeant Nikannen!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_4_AlanMiller_NPC	I see! Give me a moment, I just need to go into the archives.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_5_AlanMiller_NPC	Here you go! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal	Thanks! Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal	Nice house!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal	Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal	Let's go inside!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal	I got something.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal	Some stuff, and a note…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default	Soraks!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default	So they're involved, for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default	I'll find the rest and kill them!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Clear skies! Did you go to the house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal	Yes - and I found this note!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Interesting - and surprising!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal	Surprising? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal	Anyway, this was written by the real spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	So what?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang	Good luck finding the writer!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal	Yes, that's it! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	What do you mean? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal	The note - the writing reveals the spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal	Because they wanted to keep me safe!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal	So we have our list of suspects!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Exactly!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC	Clear skies! What can I do for you today? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal	We need to consult the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC	Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC	It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang	Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC	Ah, you're too smart for you own good.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC	Ah - I expected you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default	Ceannard. 
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC	You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC	To think the Soraks were already here…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC	…manipulating me…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default	It's in the past.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default	Though I'd like you to restore my family's name.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC	The paperwork is under way.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC	Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default	Great thanks.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC	Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC	Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC	Someone came to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default	Me? Who?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC	An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC	He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default	Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default	Everything all right?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default	Like she said - an old acquaintance.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC	You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default	How are you, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC	It's nice that you pretend to care…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default	Are you going to hate me forever?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC	I don't hate you. I just…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC	…well, it was your right to leave and…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC	…pursue a life of adventure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC	Even if it wastes your academic talent.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default	It serves me well, thanks to you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC	Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC	Times have been hard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC	The Guild offered me a posting… south.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default	You're not getting your department chair?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC	Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC	That's why I wanted to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC	I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default	That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC	There is an old Tirmarian tower there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default	Oh, yes. Very impressive, too.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC	If I could just explore it - bring something back…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC	Something the Guild couldn't ignore…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC	I would have a chance at this chair.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC	The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC	But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default	…and that's us.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC	It could salvage my career!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default	Of course. I owe you that much, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC	Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default	We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default	Clear skies, friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC	Clear skies, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN	How's business in Caer Lem?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN	What's your name?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN	Did you find the secret passage?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Have you seen Master Dackin?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice	How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC	Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC	Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC	Still, there's been no sign of them since…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC	…so we mostly pretend it didn't happen.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default	Huh - good for you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC	I'm Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default	Good to meet you, Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC	I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC	They must have dug a little too hard in there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default	I'm sure we can solve this little problem.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC	The Antiquarian? Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC	He's in the courtyard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC	He's been staring at the tower…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC	…trying to figure a way to get up there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC	But he can't fly… wait, can he?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default	Seems not.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC	There you are!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default	Are you ready for this?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC	I am. Any idea how to get up there?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default	One or two.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC	I tried to think of a way, but…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC	…still, this place is incredible!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC	Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default	As a matter of fact, I did.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default	Let's get to it, if you don't mind.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC	Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC	You must have seen so much!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default	I have. But this is still…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC	…fascinating.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default	Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default	Let's look around.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default	Gather all the antiques we can.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC	By all the gods!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC	This is really something. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default	It explains the library we found down in the caves.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC	The place seems… dangerous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default	Definitely. Be ready for a fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC	Wait - you know me. I don't fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default	Are you all right, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC	I am… alive, or so it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default	Those are quite common in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC	Just tell me there's something valuable down here!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default	Oh, I think you'll be happy.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC	This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default	Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC	I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC	These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC	…And thank you. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default	You're welcome, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC	I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default	Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC	Stay in the light, my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default	You, too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC	Hey! Interested in a little side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default	What kind of side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC	The kind that takes particular skills and contacts.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC	In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default	Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default	Say what you mean - the underworld, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC	And there I was trying to be discreet.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default	Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC	Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC	Tell her I sent you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default	Merton says you got a problem.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC	Uh… Arwin…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC	What makes you think you can help?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default	Not saying I can, yet. But I know people.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC	People who can track down stolen goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default	What kind of goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC	A sword. Imperial.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC	The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default	Probably? What does it probably do?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC	Never got a chance to find out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default	You offering a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC	I'll make it worth your while.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default	Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC	Very funny.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default	Hey, Nel! Still laughing?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC	Like Misaye herself! You?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC	Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC	For?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default	A nice antique sword with three diamonds.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default	Hear anything?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC	Something. Talk to Gorim.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default	So that's your former life, walking the streets?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default	And cutting the throats of people who crossed me.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default	Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default	A very particular one.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC	How particular?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default	Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default	Sound familiar?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC	Too expensive for me. I turned him down.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default	He have a name?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC	Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC	The Arcaneum has money.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default	Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Gorim_NPC	Thank me by buying something.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Lowlife_Default	Another time, but I will.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Gorim_NPC	I'll remember!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern1_Karel_NPC	Hey, Karel!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default	Back again?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC	Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC	The Arcaneum guy?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC	Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default	Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default	I've been looking for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC	I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	You have a stolen sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Let's make a deal.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	You're in trouble.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1	Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2	You have a sword that doesn't belong to you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success	Listen, I don't want any trouble… 
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure	You deaf or something? I said, get lost!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1	You're waiting for someone to buy a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2	Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success	How do you…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2	Doesn't matter.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2	What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3	It had better be a pretty big favor.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure	I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure	…and get paid too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1	It's about that very nice sword…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2	…that you're thinking of selling…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3	…to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2	What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3	What?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4	You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5	…and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6	The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC	Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7	Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8	I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1	Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed	Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern38_Thief_NPC	The Council? Oh, come on…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern39_Thief_NPC	It's in Misaye's temple for safekeeping.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern40_Thief_NPC	Ask Nel for a bowl of soup.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Lowlife_Default	Nel? I just talked to him… I should have known…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Cynical_Default	Bowl of soup? That's the worst password I've ever heard!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple1_Lowlife_Default	Hey, Nel. So, I'm supposed to ask you for, uh…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple2_Nel_NPC	A bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple3_Lowlife_Default	You knew? 
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple4_Nel_NPC	Of course! Misaye sees all!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple5_Lowlife_Default	And you didn't tell me because…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple6_Nel_NPC	This was more fun!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple7_Lowlife_Default	For you and Misaye, I'm sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple8_Lowlife_Default	Well, I won't be a grouch about it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple9_Nel_NPC	Aww! Misaye loves to tease a grouch!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple10_Nel_NPC	Ask properly!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple11_Lowlife_Default	Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple12_Nel_NPC	Rules are rules!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple13_Lowlife_Default	Rules - you? Oh, wait - only when it's fun, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple14_Nel_NPC	You're learning!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple15_Lowlife_Default	All right, then. chaplain Nel - may I please have a bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple16_Nel_NPC	Of course! It's in that chest.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple17_Lowlife_Default	This locked chest? I should have known.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple18_Lowlife_Default	Got it!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple19_Lowlife_Default	I can't get it…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple20_Nel_NPC	Make a donation to Misaye for luck?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple21_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	<i>Give 1 gold piece</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_Lowlife_Default	Take it, you crook.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple23_Lowlife_Default	I don't think so.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple24_Nel_NPC	Your coin made Misaye smile!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple25_Nel_NPC	Try again, Misaye will help, this time.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple26_Lowlife_Default	Still nothing!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple27_Nel_NPC	Maybe you need to be more generous!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple28_Nel_NPC	You probably used the wrong number…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple29_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	<i>Give 5 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_Nel_NPC	Fine. Let's hope your skills are up to it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple31_Nel_NPC	Have you trained in your skills since the last time?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple32_Nel_NPC	You're welcome. Misaye's laughing!

Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest90_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC	You're back! Did you get it?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest91_Scavengers2_Lowlife_Default	Here! And you mentioned a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest92_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC	Beside my undying gratitude? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest1_Lawkeeper_Default	Hey, shorty! You in the army?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest2_Stig_NPC	Don't call me that! I'm a Royal Guard, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest3_Lawkeeper_Default	You… really? The Princess, and all?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest4_Stig_NPC	Yeah. Those your friends?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest5_Friendly_Default	We are. How do you know each other?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest6_Stig_NPC	You didn't tell them?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest7_Stig_NPC	We were in the City Guard together.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest8_Lawkeeper_Default	And we both… upgraded.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC	Anyway, I need help.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest10_Stig_NPC	I think someone's rotten in the Guard.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest11_Selfpres_Default	That's reassuring…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest12_Pragmatic_Default	We have important things to do, mind you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default	Hey, Stig is my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest14_Pragmatic_Default	Fine.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest15_Stig_NPC	I need to go. Meet me at the Palace entrance when you… have time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest16_Lawkeeper_Default	Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest17_Stig_NPC	Hey, there. You ready?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest18_Lawkeeper_Default	Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest21_Any	So, what can we do to help?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest22_Stig_NPC	I have four suspects. Here are their names and posts.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest23_Stig_NPC	It won't be easy.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest24_Stig_NPC	They mustn't know I suspect them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest25_Lawkeeper_Default	We'll check them out - no problem!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest26_Stig_NPC	Strike true!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge27_Cynical_Default	All right. Stig says he should be leaving soon.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge28_Lawful_Default	There he goes. Let him get a head start.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge29_Lawful_Default	…let's find a spot with a good view and wait for the night.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default	Now that's a conspiracy!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default	There might be an angry husband.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default	It might be worth an arrest.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default	Shut up!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance34_Friendly_Default	Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance35_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	I know you - you're the Sorak killers!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance36_Lawkeeper_Default	Anything you want to share… off the books?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance37_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	What?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance38_Lawkeeper_Default	A little business of yours.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance39_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	Oh. Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance40_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	Not here, though. Meet me at the promontory, tonight.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance41_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	Quiet place. I like it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance42_Lawkeeper_Default	So, what have you got?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance43_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	In a rush, eh? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance44_Lawkeeper_Default	Booze? Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance45_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	Hey, you asked for it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance46_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	My boss would kill me for selling New Empire liquor.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance47_Lawkeeper_Default	This isn't illegal?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance48_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC	Of course not! Just… you know… Imperial. Slaver stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance49_Lawkeeper_Default	Never mind. Our mistake. Sorry to waste your time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk50_Drunk_NPC	This is my seat!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk51_Drunk_NPC	I always sit here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk52_Drunk_NPC	You're a strange bunch, you know that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk53_Drunk_NPC	Even stranger than that Arwin Merton.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk54_Drunk_NPC	Are you gonna say something?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk55_Drunk_NPC	Knew it. You Council pawns are fake.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk56_Drunk_NPC	Killed Soraks? Right. And I've got a dragon in my pocket.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk57_Drunk_NPC	Now you're pissing me off.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk58_Lawkeeper_Default	Well, I'm not sure he's smart enough to be corrupt.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk59_Any_Default	Think he can work? He can barely stand!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk60_Any_Default	Let's go and see, then.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk61_Lawkeeper_Default	What is he doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk62_Partner_Default	Hijacking a crate from a delivery.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk63_Lawkeeper_Default	Let's see what's in it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk64_Lawkeeper_Default	Flowers?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk65_Herbalism_Default	Angry Violets, hundreds of them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk66_Drunk_NPC	Hey! What are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk67_Persuasion_WRITTEN	We just want a share of the loot.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk68_Intimidation_WRITTEN	You're clearly a thief - admit it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk69_Deception_WRITTEN	We're investigating you for Captain Ironshell.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN	The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE	We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL	You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE	We caught you red-handed. Just confess.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk74_Intimidation_FAIL	You're a bunch of idiots, I'll confess that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk75_Deception_FAIL	Captain Ironshell asked us to investigate you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk76_Drunk_FAIL	Oh yeah? That's a good one. She asked me to bring this to the Palace.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk77_Default_FAIL	The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk78_Drunk_FAIL	My job. What did you think I was doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk79_Lawkeeper_Default	Why did you pick this crate out of the delivery?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk80_Drunk_NPC	Oh, this one? 
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk81_Drunk_NPC	Let me think. 
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk82_Drunk_NPC	This is for her Royal Highness, going through Captain Ironshell directly.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk83_Drunk_NPC	I'm sure the Princess will appreciate you rummaging through her personal stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC	As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default	I knew that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC	Ask the Captain. Go right ahead.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default	That won't be necessary. Carry on.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC	Rodric isn't here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC	Rodric? He's on an errand.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple90_Any_Default	Nothing. We're wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple91_Lawkeeper_Default	This Rodric, though - where is he?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple92_Any_Default	Let's check again.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple93_Lawkeeper_Default	You're Rodric?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple94_Alrin_NPC	Who's asking?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple95_Lawkeeper_Default	We're Council deputies…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End96_Any_Default	What was that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End97_Any_Default	He's not just a Guard, that's for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End98_Arcana_Default	That's a shadowcaster trick! He can't be far!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End99_Lawkeeper_Default	Look for tracks.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default	A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default	What have you found?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End102_Any_Default	Enough to implicate Rodric and his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End103_Any_Default	They were smuggling goods in and out of the Temple Quarter.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End104_Lawkeeper_Default	Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End105_Stig_NPC	I heard what happened! Rodric's a shadowcaster?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End106_Lawkeeper_Default	Rodric's a corpse. He attacked us with a bunch of his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default	Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End108_Stig_NPC	Fantastic! Thanks for the help, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End109_Lawkeeper_Default	Stay in the light, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start1_Mayor_NPC	A moment, if you please, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start2_Aristocrat_Default	Lady Bright-Spark? How may we help you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start3_Mayor_NPC	You could start by not calling me that.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start4_Aristocrat_Default	As you wish.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start5_Mayor_NPC	I have a messy business on my desk, and your name's on it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start6_Aristocrat_Default	My name?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start7_Mayor_NPC	It's an inheritance…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start8_Mayor_NPC	…with a bunch of people contesting the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start9_Aristocrat_Default	What? Who died?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start10_Mayor_NPC	The honorable Joan Tannerson.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start11_Aristocrat_Default	Oh. I see.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start12_Anyother_Default	Family?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start13_Aristocrat_Default	She was… my mentor. A renowned lawyer.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start14_Cynical_Default	You're a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start15_Aristocrat_Default	Do I look like a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default	Wouldn't put it past you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default	What is the mess, exactly?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start18_Mayor_NPC	Tannerson left you everything, according to the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start19_Mayor_NPC	Her children aren't happy, and the notary is very… annoying.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start20_Mayor_NPC	So please - do something. Anything. Just make them stop harassing me.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start21_Mayor_NPC	I have more important things to deal with.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start22_Aristocrat_Default	Perhaps I should talk to the children first.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start23_Mayor_NPC	Do whatever you want, as long as it shuts this notary up!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start24_Aristocrat_Default	Right. Thank you… my lady.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start25_Mayor_NPC	Tsss…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew11_Aristocrat_Default	Drew! How are you holding up?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew12_Drew_NPC	Look - it's the famous heir. Should I bow?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default	Listen, I have no idea…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC	Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default	Can we talk?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC	Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default	He needs a smack in the mouth.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew18_Aristocrat_Default	He's… grieving.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew19_Violent_Default	I'll give him something to grieve over.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria11_Aristocrat_Default	Lyria, I'm so very sorry for your loss.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria12_Lyria_NPC	Oh - you're the… well… I knew she liked you, but…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria13_Aristocrat_Default	Frankly, this all seems like a prank.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria14_Lyria_NPC	Right? That's what I told the notary.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria15_Lyria_NPC	Goodbye.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria16_Lowlife_Default	These people!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria11_Aristocrat_Default	Adria! How are you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria12_Adria_NPC	Well, sad, of course. You?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria13_Aristocrat_Default	Thanks for asking. A bit down, of course.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria14_Aristocrat_Default	She taught me so much.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria15_Adria_NPC	I know. She was proud of you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria16_Aristocrat_Default	Thank you. 
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria17_Aristocrat_Default	Listen - this will. It bothers me…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria18_Aristocrat_Default	…I really don't want to quarrel with you and your siblings.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria19_Adria_NPC	I'm afraid you won't have a choice.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC	Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default	What would you do with the inheritance?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria112_Adria_NPC	Me? Share it with the two other sharks, just to stay alive.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria113_Aristocrat_Default	Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack1_Anyother_Default	They're not bandits.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack2_Aristocrat_Default	No. More like hired assassins.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack3_Anyother_Default	You know what this means.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack4_Aristocrat_Default	Stay alert. The notary's mansion might not be safe either.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending1_Cynical_Default	Oh, look - they're all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC	So you left Caer Cyflen without a word. 
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending3_Drew_NPC	How rude.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending4_Aristocrat_Default	Can we take this inside?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending5_Lyria_NPC	Just tell us what you decided and stop wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC	At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default	The Circle of Danantar will reward you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC	Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default	My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default	Adria?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC	I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending12_Drew_NPC	What? Did the Soraks replace you or something?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending13_Lyria_NPC	Even from you, Drew, that's low.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending14_Notary_NPC	Ah, so you are all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending15_Notary_NPC	Why didn't you come in?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending16_Aristocrat_Default	You're right. Let's finish this.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending17_WRITTEN_ChoiceA	The inheritance is mine.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending18_WRITTEN_ChoiceB	<i>Choose an heir from among the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending19_WRITTEN_ChoiceC	<i>Split the inheritance four ways.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending20_WRITTEN_ChoiceD	<i>Split the inheritance between the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending21_Aristocrat_ChoiceA	Your mother left me everything. Her will should be respected.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending22_Aristocrat_ChoiceC	We'll split the inheritance between the four of us.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending23_Aristocrat_ChoiceD	You should each get a third of the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending24_WRITTEN_ChoiceE	<i>Give the inheritance to Lyria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending25_WRITTEN_ChoiceF	<i>Give the inheritance to Drew.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending26_WRITTEN_ChoiceG	<i>Give the inheritance to Adria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending27_Aristocrat_ChoiceE	I'll give Lyria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending28_Aristocrat_ChoiceF	I'll give Drew the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending29_Aristocrat_ChoiceG	I'll give Adria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending30_Lyria_NPC	Excellent!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending31_Drew_NPC	By all the gods…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending32_Drew_NPC	Yes!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending33_Lyria_NPC	What? Why?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending34_Adria_NPC	Thank you! I'll share with you both, you know it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC	Well, that's settled, then.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC	I will magically seal the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC	I'm sorry, the law forbids it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC	You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC	You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC	Fine… I thought I had cracked you…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default	What?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default	Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default	She killed all her siblings?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default	Maybe she was a Sorak agent?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default	They were all my childhood friends…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default	Oh, yes. Sorry.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default	It's over. Let's go.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default	Who's this? Seems to like wolves.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success	Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE	Let's kill them!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE	Let's get out of here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE	Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default	Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default	Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default	Out here, there's no such thing as "can't hurt." 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default	Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default	We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default	He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE	Hello!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE	Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default	Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success	Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success	We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success	Not much. What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure	You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure	Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default	Hey, you! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success	I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success	What do you know about that castle over there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success	What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Ha! Aren't you tough?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Believe me, you don't want me coming over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Now get lost, before I change my mind!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE	Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE	How strong is the garrison?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE	Who is its ruler?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default	Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC	I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC	He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default	Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC	No.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default	And there's no one else outside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default	Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default	What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC	The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default	Mostly?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC	That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default	Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC	Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default	Probably undead? Why do you say that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC	Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit	Thanks, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default	Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC	Talbut.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal	Look! What's that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal	Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal	Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE	Let's destroy it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE	Let's keep moving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE	Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default	The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default	An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default	I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE	We have questions.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE	Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal	Hello! Could we ask you some questions?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal	Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC	Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate	Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default	What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC	Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default	And the other?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC	Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC	…and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default	Is there anyone else?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC	There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi	Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default	How can we help you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi	I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default	And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi	Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal	Now, that's just rude. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi	As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal	Well, that's just you all over!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal	You can rely on us.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi	It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi	Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi	…but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal	Now, that's what I call work ethic.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi	And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi	…I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi	But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi	…and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal	We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default	Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman	Yes - what is it?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default	We have something for you. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi	Or rather, someONE.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman	Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi	It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi	These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman	Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman	On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman	I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi	Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman	Your report?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi	One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi	…so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi	I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman	Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi	Capital! We're distant cousins, you know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman	No, I didn't.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC	You there! Stop! Don't move!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC	Who are you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE	We should leave.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE	We should attack.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE	We should negotiate.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE	We should trick him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default	He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default	It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default	Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default	Will you at least hear us before we go?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal	…long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal	…the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal	The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal	Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success	It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure	I may be dead, but I'm not stupid.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2	The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC	Take your lies and get out!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal	We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal	You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC	I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC	I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC	I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal	We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	You want to steal from him, more like!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal	No - I swear…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC	Who are you? What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Ask for mercy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE	To destroy you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE	To meet your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE	To make a deal.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default	Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal	What we want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC	I know this place. You don't. Let's trade.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal	All right - talk.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Who do you think you're dealing with? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC	That tough act may impress the girls back home…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2	…but I've seen scarier things in the mirror.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default	You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal	We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal	All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2	There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal	What things?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure	You must think I'm a complete idiot.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC	Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal	Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal	…as long as you don't do it to us, of course.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal	But the thing is, we've come a very long way…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2	…and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC	Really?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal	Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC	What's it about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal	Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2	They come from the very highest level.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC	I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2	There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC	Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2	If anyone can persuade the master, she can.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC	If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal	Who's Aksha?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC	A defiler. She lives upstairs. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC	She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC	…and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC	I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC	She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2	…but they don't sound like him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC	I know - knew him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2	He was my mentor, my teacher.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3	She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal	So we'll have to go through her? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC	If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2	…and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC	We've tried using force before, more than once…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2	…but I got sick of losing people. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal	Thanks for the warning.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2	Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal	…what's the best way to approach him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC	Hard to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2	The Cataclysm hit him hard…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3	…and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC	The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC	Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter	We're no one's minions, lady.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC	You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Step away!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE	We'll destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE	We just want to talk to Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE	We can offer you blood.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult	We need to speak to your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult	You can get out of our way or try to stop us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default	Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default	We ask a simple boon:
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2	An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default	We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default	What does that mean - getting sense out of him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Kill them! Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC	Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal	(low voice) How about blood?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2	Not mine, of course…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3	…but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC	You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal	Crazy? What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	You must think I was born yesterday…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal	We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2	We need his knowledge.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC	Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal	What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC	You'll see.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	Let me think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC	He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2	Keeps raving about gods coming to get him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC	The Minor Gate is the only way in.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default	Minor Gate?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC	Yes. Over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC	Who are you? How did you get in here?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default	Master Mardracht?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC	You know my name! How do you know my name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default	We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC	No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC	Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Can't you see we're too strong?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE	We don't want to kill you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE	We want to save Solasta.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default	We found you and we breached your defenses.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2	Do you really want to test your power against ours?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default	You are right to fear us, and those who sent us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2	We are powerful - but you don't have to die.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default	All we ask is that you hear what we have to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2	After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP	If you are not here to kill me - then what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal	I offer you the chance to buy your life.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2	Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success	For my life? I… 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure	Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default	The gods have commanded us to kill you…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC	I knew it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal	…but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal	We must have the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC	The gem… ? But…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal	But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2	Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success	I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure	You have the Crown? No!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC	I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2	To destroy Solasta!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default	We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2	…specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC	What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal	We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal	But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	But wait - the Crown is active?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2	And it chose you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal	Well… Yes. We're not sure why.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC	The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2	This is no task for the likes of you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC	I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal	But…?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC	NOW!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC	This is what you came for.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC	Take it - and leave me alone!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default	The gem's in the castle?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default	Maybe. It's in that direction.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default	That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default	There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default	We could just show our Legacy Council credentials.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default	Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default	…Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default	We're not getting in that way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default	Could we climb up?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default	It's too open. We'd be easy targets.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default	We'll have to find another way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default	Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default	Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default	…probably used right up to the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default	Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default	Everyone knows the undead are deaf!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default	Another door.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default	Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default	Look at the top. What is that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default	Looks like a magical shield of some sort.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default	Some sort? How many sorts are there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default	What we're looking for is up there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default	You're sure?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default	It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default	This could be our way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default	Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default	…into water that's who knows how deep…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default	…and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default	This drain could be a way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default	Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default	Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default	Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default	That doesn't look right.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default	It's a drain. What's wrong with that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default	Yes, but inside a building?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default	Maybe the roof leaks.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default	Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default	That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default	Unless…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default	I swear, if you say something smart…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default	I never say anything that's not. But think about it:
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default	It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default	Are you saying it's a secret entrance?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default	The outside graves were likely for servants and guards.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default	The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default	The most important graves are in the catacombs down below.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default	And by "important," you mean "rich."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default	So - this is a Minor Gate?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default	And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default	Did you see any other way to get there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default	So we're just going to trust her?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default	That looks like a Minor Gate.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default	Where do you suppose it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default	To the Master's floor, hopefully.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default	Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default	We've heard how paranoid this Master is.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default	So - are we going?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default	Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default	So that's it?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default	Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default	Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default	That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default	Stop it. You know we can't do that.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default	We must get it back to the Council.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default	Can't blame me for trying.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default	Ugh. Teleporting feels weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default	I wonder what this Mardracht is like?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default	If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default	Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default	It's a book!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default	You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default	That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default	It's in the common tongue: "The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default	Those must be his bones here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default	I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default	That was the ghost we met earlier! 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default	What's this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default	Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default	You're not as funny as you think you are.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default	It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default	Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default	What's this? 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default	It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default	What language is this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default	Draconic. They say it's older than high elven.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default	Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default	Well, everyone said he was paranoid.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default	Or… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default	What? He's a dragon? How would that work?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default	The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default	That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default	That looks weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default	It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default	Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default	It hasn't done anything yet.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default	It doesn't work? I wonder…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default	Don't. Just don't.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default	Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil8_Any_Default	I hate you.

Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_2_Pragmatism_Default	Better be sure!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_3_Kythaela_NPC	Who art thou?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_4_AcademicOrElse_Default	Old elvish! We are friends, my lady!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_5_Kythaela_NPC	The Master sent you?  
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_6_Any_Default	Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_7_Kythaela_NPC	How dare you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_8_Pragmatism_Default	Dare what? Come outside and look around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_9_Kythaela_NPC	But it's… impossible!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_10_Kythaela_NPC	Where am I?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_11_Pragmatism_Slang	It's called the Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_12_Kythaela_NPC	No! I was in the Aer-Elai, the heart of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_13_Kythaela_NPC	I must find the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_14_Kythaela_NPC	Kythaela, my name is the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_15_Kythaela_NPC	…no, my name is Kythaela of the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_16_Kythaela_NPC	…whatever this shield might be. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_17_Choice1_WRITTEN	Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_18_Choice2_WRITTEN	Aer-Elai?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_19_Choice3_WRITTEN	A shield?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_20_Choice1_Spoken	Which Master are you talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_21_Choice2_Spoken	Aer-Elai? The heart of the Empire? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_22_Choice3_Spoken	What is this shield you're talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_23_Kythaela_NPC	The Master of… I can't remember. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_24_Kythaela_NPC	Yes, this tower was in the Aer-Elai, a haven of peace!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_25_Kythaela_NPC	The shield is the master, and the master is the shield! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_26_Kythaela_NPC	But tell me - what happened? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_27_Any_Default	A thousand years ago, the Cataclysm ravaged the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_28_Kythaela_NPC	Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_29_Helpfulness_Default	My lady, what is the last thing you remember? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_30_Kythaela_NPC	I don't remember any Cataclysm… I remember… a large room…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_31_Kythaela_NPC	…people speaking about a rift, a great threat to the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_32_Kythaela_NPC	…strange creatures with strange powers…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_33_Choice_Academic_WRITTEN	You mean THE Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_34_Choice_Academic_Spoken	A rift? Do you mean THE rift? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_35_Kythaela_NPC	Are there more than one?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_36_Choice2_WRITTEN	Creatures? The Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_37_Choice2_Spoken	Strange creatures - yes, the Soraks, of course! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_38_Kythaela_NPC	No - they were called… humans…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_39_Kythaela_NPC	…strange beings, with magic that was not arcane. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_40_Kythaela_ifHumanAdventurer_NPC	They actually looked just like you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_41_AcademicOrElse_Default	Fascinating! You witnessed a council of war! Can you recall anything else?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_42_Kythaela_NPC	One of the beings was wearing THIS Crown, scintillating with gems. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_43_Kythaela_NPC	They called him Magister, with the utmost respect! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_44_Kythaela_NPC	But you are not him. Where did you find this Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_45_Choice1_WRITTEN	You met the Magister?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_46_Choice1_Spoken	The Magister? And this was his Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_47_Choice2_WRITTEN	Scintillating?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_48_Choice2_Spoken	Scintillating with gems, you say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_49_Choice3_WRITTEN	We found this Crown.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_50_Choice3_Spoken	We found this Crown in another part of the Badlands.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_51_Kythaela_NPC	He was wearing it, at least.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_52_Kythaela_NPC	Yes. The Crown was set with eight large gems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_53_Kythaela_NPC	There are no Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_54_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Just look outside, lady! The Badlands are real! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_55_SellswordOrElse_Slang	And we had to fight Soraks to get the Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_56_Kythaela_NPC	Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_57_Any_Default	The scourge of humanity.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_58_Any_Default	They ran the humans out of Tirmar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_59_Any_Default	…and came here to finish the job!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_60_Kythaela_NPC	The humans weren't the enemy? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_61_Choice1_WRITTEN	They were refugees!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_62_Choice1_Spoken	No! They were refugees, fleeing the Soraks!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_63_Kythaela_NPC	Refugees? Eager to join the enlightenment of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_64_AcademicOrElse_Default	Slavery isn't enlightenment! Those days died with the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_65_Kythaela_NPC	Silence, wretch! The Empire can't be dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_66_Any_NonHighElf_Rude	The Empire died with the Cataclysm! And even if it galls me to admit it…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_67_AcademicOrElse_Default	…it saved Solasta from a horrible fate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_68_Choice2_WRITTEN	They warned the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_69_Choice2_Spoken	They convinced the Empire of the real threat.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_70_Kythaela_NPC	Those Soraks you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_71_AcademicOrElse_Default	Yes! Dangerous, evil lizards, able to wield magic and to subvert minds!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_72_Kythaela_NPC	Weak human minds, for sure! And yet…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_73_AcademicOrElse_Default	And yet?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_74_Kythaela_NPC	Yet I recall an elf, a member of the household, trying to kill the Master…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_75_Choice3_WRITTEN	They joined forces.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_76_Choice3_Spoken	Their combined forces assaulted the Rift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_77_Kythaela_NPC	There was mention of the Rift in the Aer-Elai.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_78_Any_Default	They managed to close it - but triggered the Cataclysm, ushering in a dark age!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_79_Kythaela_NPC	The dark age? Those Badlands you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_80_Any_NPC	Yes! A thousand years of rebuilding after near extinction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_81_Kythaela_NPC	It can't be! I still feel the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_82_Kythaela_NPC	And I must find him!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_83_Any_Default	Times have changed since you last traveled in the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_84_Kythaela_NPC	Still, I feel the pull! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_85_Any_Default	The pull?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_86_Kythaela_NPC	Yes, a pull to get to the Copper Vale of Remembrance! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_87_Kythaela_NPC	Take me there at once and I shall name you favored servants!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_88_Crownbearer_Default	The Copper Vale of Remembrance? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_89_Kythaela_NPC	Yes - a fortress and place of rest for fallen heroes, roughly in this direction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_90_Choice1_WRITTEN	The Vale of Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_91_Choice1_Spoken	Copper, fortress… hmmm - sounds like the Vale of Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_92_Choice2_WRITTEN	We're not your servants.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_93_Choice2_Spoken	We are no one's servants, favored or otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_94_Kythaela_NPC	Traveling companions, then!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_95_Kythaela_NPC	You can tell me of this Cataclysm on our journey!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_96_Choice3_WRITTEN	You seem sure we'll agree.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_97_Choice3_Spoken	You seem very certain that we'll go with you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_98_Kythaela_NPC	Of course - you wouldn't let a lady cross those Badlands alone, surely? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_1Galar_NPC	A timely arrival! Many thanks for your help! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_2_Pragmatism_Default	Clear skies, friend! What's going on here? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_3Galar_NPC	Those… fellows joined my caravan at Coparann…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_4Galar_NPC	…a couple of hours ago, this man stumbled on our path, almost dead…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_5Galar_NPC	…no healing could help him, so I put him in a tent…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_6Galar_NPC	…and I was about to send word to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_7_Choice1Pragmatism_WRITTEN	Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_8_Choice1Pragmatism_Spoken	Coparann? That's where we're going!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_9Galar_NPC	Then perhaps you can do me a favor! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_10_CynicismOrElse_Default	A favor? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_11Galar_NPC	Of course I'll see that you're rewarded! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_12_Choice2Starter_WRITTEN	Almost dead?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_13_Choice2Starter_Spoken	Almost dead? Sick? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC	No, wounded! Deep wounds…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC	…ripped open, as if by sharp claws.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC	We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default	Claw wounds? And no healing could help him? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC	That's right. The wounds were oozing.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC	It's a wonder he was still alive.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN	Send word? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken	Why send word?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC	Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default	You want us to take word of his death to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC	Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_25Galar_NPC	Have him countersign the note, then see my agent.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_26Galar_NPC	He is the owner of the general store. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_27Galar_NPC	Meanwhile, get some rest and share our camp!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_28Galar_NPC	We can even sell you some equipment!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_29_ArunFollower_Default	Let us share Arun's gifts!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_30_Any_Default	Many thanks for your hospitality!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_1_Guard_NPC	Halt! Do you seek entrance to our fair valley?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_2_Any_Default	Yes, we do!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_3_Guard_Npc	Then go see Sergeant Nikannen in the Guardhouse!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_4_Any_Default	Thank you! Clear skies! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_5_Guard_NPC	Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_6_SgtNikannen_NPC	Good day! I am Sergeant Nikannen, officer of the day! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_7_SgtNikannen_NPC	What business brings you to Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_8_SellswordChoice1_WRITTEN	We found something.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_9_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Well, Sarge, we found something of yours on our way here!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_10_SgtNikannen_NPC	Of mine? What, exactly?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN	We have something for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default	We were asked to give you certain items! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC	Asked? By whom?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC	And what items?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN	Galar sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default	Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Here they are, Sarge!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC	The ring, the badge, the insignia…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC	The man who wore those was of middling height…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC	…broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default	Correct! You knew him, then?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC	He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC	Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_24_SgtNikannen_NPC	Now, tell me what happened to my good friend Roald!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_25_DiplomatOrElse_Default	First, please accept our sincere condolences! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_26_SgtNikannen_NPC	Thanks. Now tell me where, when, how - and who!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default	Two days ago.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default	It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default	He was found almost dead by the caravan people.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default	They tried to heal him and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default	…some travelers in the caravan rushed in…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default	…to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC	And no idea who those guys were? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default	No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default	Did Roald say anything to you? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC	Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC	…but leave Gromnir out of it for now.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN	The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken	The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN	Not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken	And why not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC	The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC	Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC	…perhaps we can discuss some more!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default	And where is the Ceannard? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC	But we need to talk to the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC	You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC	Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC	You won't talk to him without my leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC	Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC	Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC	Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC	And here's a note for the Ceannard!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default	Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_1_Ceannard_NPC	Clear skies! Joris Nikannen says you have an interesting story to tell! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_2_Any_Default	Clear skies to you, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default	Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC	Go on.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC	Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC	…but Nikannen sent you to me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC	You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC	…the one old hand who was born here. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC	We have known each other almost all our lives!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC	He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC	And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN	The Stonefist company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken	The Stonefist mercenary company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC	Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN	Orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken	An orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC	Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC	…whipped into a frenzy by a shaman.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC	They hit us hard and opened a breach…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC	…got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC	Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN	Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken	Who's Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC	Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN	That doesn't answer my question.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken	We are agents of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default	Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default	Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC	And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default	Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default	Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC	Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC	So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC	In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN	Mausoleum?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken	A place of remembrance?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC	Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC	There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC	Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN	Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken	What's Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC	A very particular kind of marble - very precious! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC	The traditional stone for the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC	As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC	We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC	So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default	Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC	Can they truly possess others?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default	Not possess, exactly…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default	…what they do is worse…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default	…if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC	Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC	…then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC	Not a word about what you told me, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default	Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC	I'll say no more for the time being!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC	Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default	Clear skies to you, Ceannard! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC	It's rather silly, really. This young man…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC	…he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC	So? He probably gambled the money away!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC	Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC	So? Where is this paragon of yours?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC	Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC	Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC	Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC	A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC	No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC	Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC	The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC	Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC	Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC	He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC	If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC	…but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC	Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC	Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC	Why's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC	A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC	That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC	Like an old couple, the two of them!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC	Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	We have a letter for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	The Ceannard sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Let's see your wares.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN	We should go.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken	Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC	Of course, of course!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC	Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC	Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC	Would you be interested in sampling our wares?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default	What do you sell?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC	A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal	The Ceannard sent us to talk to you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal	Anything unusual in recent days?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC	The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC	I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal	Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC	Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Well met again!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC	What do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	The soldiers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal	…posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	These highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken	The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	Normally the penalty is clear and swift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp	So what do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC	There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Things about Roald and the Baron.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken	What about Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC	When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC	…I was speechless, not out of grief but…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC	…because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default	You mean… one of them is… not who he seems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	The Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken	What about the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC	I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC	And that's not all…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC	For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Something is wrong. I can feel it. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Suggestions, Sarge? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC	The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC	So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC	I know what his normal reaction would be…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC	…so come back and we can compare notes. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC	And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang	As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Clear skies to you! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC	Greetings, adventurers. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC	Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal	Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC	Then let her speak for herself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC	My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC	Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC	A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC	My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC	…he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC	With your leave, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC	…I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC	Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC	Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC	…otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Ah - you're back! How did the audience go? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal	Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal	Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC	No - just pragmatic and smart! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken	Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC	It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC	He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken	Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC	…then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC	A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC	So, not like Gromnir at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Fine. What do you suggest? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC	…as envoys of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	So, what's the plan?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC	Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC	Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal	We're from the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal	My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC	And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Quite the contrary, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	…the Council would appreciate Coparann's help.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC	Why didn't you say so yesterday? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal	…in a delicate and vital matter.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal	And what's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Historical research.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC	Those… baubles have some historical value?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC	Then why not just say so?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC	Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC	I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC	Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC	That would be more than fair, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC	Then please lead the way! Where should we start? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC	In the basement, my lord! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC	Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC	Now, back to your post!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Yes, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere	Go. I'll meet you in the basement.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC	Here! This is the place! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC	And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC	Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC	…there is something I wish to show you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC	You will find it interesting, hopefully.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC	So nice of you to drop by. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC	Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC	And you will tell us everything!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC	Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal	Einar be your judge! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC	And you will give me that Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron	Is that… the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC	Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC	Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC	We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC	…the Soraks are real.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC	This changes our position towards the Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Warnings?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	About the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	About the Soraks…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken	The Council warned you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC	Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC	If anything, they weren't loud enough!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default	But we can only warn! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC	You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC	True! We won't let our guard down! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default	How does this change your position?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC	Coparann must stand with the Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Do you plan to join the Council?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Or simply to help us in our endeavors? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC	We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC	…will allow us to communicate swiftly!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC	But enough about matters of state!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC	The Ceannard has the right of it! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC	The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC	And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal	Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC	That resilience would have amounted to nothing…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC	…without your insight and your courage! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC	You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC	As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal	The keys to the town, maybe?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC	And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC	Go forth on your journey with our blessings!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC	This is the place!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal	And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal	And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal	Difficult to read anything here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal	Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC	Yes!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal	Let's head there now! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC	Not so fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC	The feast is just starting!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC	And you will make a nice main dish!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC	Master, here I am, at last!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC	Kythaela, come to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal	Kythaela could use some healing, I think!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC	Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC	I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC	An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC	…in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC	You have my thanks, whoever you are.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal	You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC	For reuniting me with Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC	For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC	This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Reuniting? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken	Reunited with her?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC	Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_9_Judgmental_Normal	Did you kill her? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal	Careful, now!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC	No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal	Kythaela was your clone? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal	I don't understand what happened here!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC	Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC	A vessel for my knowledge and memories!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal	But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC	The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Very high-level magic, then!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC	One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_21_ChoiceB_Normal	Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_22_Adrasteia_Spoken	Yes, the merging process takes time - time during which I was almost helpless!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Never seen such a creature?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal	Never met such a creature before? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC	No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC	This was a negation of life, an abomination!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC	Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_29_AcademicOrElse_Normal	You were at the battle of the Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC	Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Misconceptions? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC	Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Oh, that.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC	The Empire wasn't kind to… other races.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal	The humans surprised you, it seems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_36_Adrasteia_NPC	Yes - such bravery, such defiance! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC	They all came together to save Solasta! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC	The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_39_Adrasteia_NPC	The Iron Legions and the Shield Wall of the dwarves…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_40_Adrasteia_NPC	…holding the enemy at bay, flank to flank!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC	Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC	…giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC	And, as another wave came through…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC	…one last throw of the dice…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC	…one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal	What was it?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC	Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC	…but at this moment we resumed our true forms!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_49_Adrasteia_NPC	To secure the Rift for a few crucial moments…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_50_Adrasteia_NPC	…buying time with our lives in a furnace of magic and steel! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_51_Adrasteia_NPC	So Kaseinax finished his ritual!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_52_AcademicOrElse_Normal	With the gems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_53_Adrasteia_NPC	Take it, old friend, once again.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal	Old friend?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC	I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal	The Magister is still in the Crown? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC	Enough talk of the past.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC	Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2	I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC	…and for that, I will need all my strength.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC2	Use my Gate freely. I believe you know how.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC	We shall meet again, before the end!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC2	But before you take your leave, if you would be so kind…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC3	This creature you forced to flee still plagues my grounds with his minions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_61_Adrasteia_NPC	Would you deal with them and free their prisoners? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_62_Adrasteia_NPC	As a courtesy.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_63_Any_Default	We owe you that much. Thank you, Master Adrasteia.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Welcome	Welcome to the inn!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_StayForTheNight	Sure! Get settled!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Nomoney	No coin, no bed.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Goodbye	Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_1_Atima_NPC	Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_2_Atima_NPC	My name is Atima Bladeburn, priestess of Arun.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_3_Arun_Default	A herald of fire?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_4_Atima_NPC	It is my honor.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_5_Atima_NPC	What can I do for you?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_6_Arun_Default	Just passing by to pay our respects.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_7_Cynical_Default	Not me.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_8_Atima_NPC	Then good luck and fair weather, friends.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_9_Any_Default	Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_10_Any_Default	We need your powers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_1_Ceannard_NPC	Gromnir! Thank Einar you're safe! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_2_BaronStonefist_NPC	Yes, I am - thanks to Joris and these adventurers, it seems!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_3_Ceannard_NPC	Now, old friend - go see Atima with Joris! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_4_BaronStonefist_NPC	I'm fine!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_5_Ceannard_NPC	I knew you'd say that.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_6_Ceannard_NPC	I am the Ceannard, and you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_7_Ceannard_NPC	…you shall resume your duties only if our cleric says you're fit enough.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_8_BaronStonefist_NPC	But -
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_9_Ceannard_NPC	No buts! I shall secure the Keep and the valley till you're back!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_10_Ceannard_NPC	As for you, my friends, find Lady Kythaela's belongings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_11_Ceannard_NPC	…and meet me in the throne room.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Formal	Strike true!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Normal	Will do.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_1_CrownbearerOrArcane_Highest_Normal	Tell us, Lady Kythaela, what did you find? A gem? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2_Kythaela_NPC	This is my spellbook - I remember!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2b_Kythaela_NPC	A wand, a robe, some money, and a piece of paper.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_3_CrownbearerOrHighestInsighet_Normal	What does it say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_4_Kythaela_NPC	I… don't know. There is only one word written on the paper: "Adrasteo"
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_5_SarcasticOrElse_Normal	Is that another place?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_6_Kythaela_NPC	I… I'm not sure! I feel the pull returning!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_7_InsightOrElse_Normal	I guess we'll soon be on the road again, then.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_8_SarcasticOrElse_Normal	More monsters to kill… fantastic…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_9_PerceptionHighest_Normal	What about that door? Another secret from Imperial times?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_1_ArcanaHighest_Normal	A Major Gate! Captain Ironshell was right.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_2_Sarcastic_Normal	About the cleanliness of the rooms in the Residence?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_3_ArcanaHighest_Normal	About functional Gates, you dimwit!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_4_Sarcastic_Normal	This dusty old room?   
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_5_ArcanaHighest_Normal	Yes, look at it! It's perfectly intact.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_8_Kythaela_NPC	It is locked, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_9_InsightHighest_Normal	How do we unlock it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_10_Kythaela_NPC	You need to use its name. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_11_Kythaela_NPC	It would normally be engraved nearby, but this was a private, secret Gate.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_12_Pragmatic_Normal	So, we can't use it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_13_Kythaela_NPC	I know its name, this was my family's.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_14_Pragmatic_Normal	So…?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_15_Kythaela_NPC	Once you get me to my master, I'll give you the name.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_16_Pragmatic_Normal	I guess that's fair.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_17_Friendly_Normal	And then, we teleport to Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_18_Friendly_Normal	That's fantastic!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_19_Pragmatic_Normal	I'm not sure the Ceannard will want to wait.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_20_Kythaela_NPC	Then I'll give him the name, but you still have to stay with me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_21_Cynical_Default	She's tough, but at least she doesn't sound crazy anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_22_Kythaela_NPC	Watch your words, you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_23_Kythaela_NPC	…never mind.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_1_Default_Default	This is the worst place we've been so far.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_2_Reactor_Normal	It sure does stink - sulfur, I think.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_3_Reactor_Slang	And it stinks like an orc's backside.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_4_Reactor_Formal	Indeed, the smell here is awful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_5_Pragmatic_Default	We're deep in the Badlands, sure - but there is a gem around here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_6_Selfpres_Default	You never know. Remember the Gem of Abjuration? 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_7_Selfpres_Default	The Crown's signal was just a decoy to find Kythaela.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_8_Default_Default	Look, is that an orc totem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_9_Default_Default	An orc… woman?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_10_Kill_CHOICE	Let's kill her!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_11_Save_CHOICE	We could save her.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_12_Leave_CHOICE	Let's move on.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_13_Speak_CHOICE	Let's think about it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_14_Kill_Default	It's an orc. We kill orcs, right?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_15_Pragmatic_Default	She might know something about the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_16_Save_Default	She's helpless! Let's show mercy for once.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_17_Kill_Slang	No glory in slaughtering someone who's already down.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_18_Kill_Formal	I say we save her life - even if she probably wouldn't do the same for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_19_Medecine_Default	I'll take care of that - she'll be on her feet very soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_20_Leave_Default	Who cares? Let's keep looking for the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_21_Speak_Default	What's the risk, here? She's alone and wounded.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_22_Arcana_Default	She's a shaman. She could cast a spell on us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_23_Pragmatic_Default	Maybe she knows something about the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_24_Nosy_Default	To be honest, I'd like to know what happened here. Who killed all those orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_25_Kebra_NPC	You… healed me?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_26_Kebra_NPC	Why not kill me?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_27_Neutral_Choice	What happened?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_28_Friendly_CHOICE	Who are you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_29_Pragmatic_CHOICE	Have you heard of a magic gem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_30_Orcishspeaker_CHOICE	Trust us. (in orcish)
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_31_Pragmatic_Default	We'd like to know what happened here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_32_Friendly_Default	What's your name?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_33_Kebra_NPC	Name is Kebra…

Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_16_Any_Default	Ancestors were great warriors from the Endless Range.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_17_ChoiceB_Default	What's the Endless Range?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_18_History_Default	A name for the plains of Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_19_Default_Default	Orcs were Tirmarian?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_20_History_Default	No.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_21_Any_Default	We don't have time for historical debates.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_22_ChoiceC_Default	We know enough.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_23_Choice3_Default	Let's find this Old Queen, then.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_1_Default_NPC	Webs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_2_Selfpres_NPC	Oh, no? That's what the Old Queen is? Another spider?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_3_Violent_Default	We can deal with a spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_4_Default_Default	Even two.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_5_Violent_Default	But a very, very big deep spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_6_Selfpres_Default	Come on! How big can it be?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_7_Cynical_NPC	We should bring its head back to the Council. Faisech will love it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_1_Pragmatic_Default	What happened?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_2_Arcana_Default	It's magical darkness.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_3_Selfpres_Default	We need light! It's an extra-super big deep spider!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_4_Default_Default	And it has anti-light magic?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_5_Selfpres_Default	This is insane! Let's go back!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_6_Selfpres_Default	I'd rather kill all the orcs in that damned volcano than walk down this spider pit in the pitch dark.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default	There has to be a way.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default	I promise I'll never scoff at 'anything is possible in the Badlands' again.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default	At least we got it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default	Hopefully, that means another orc tribe behind us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default	You really want to give up this axe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default	Look at it? it's a masterpiece!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_6_Nosy_Default	Tirmarian smiths were just as good as the elves of Manacalon!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_7_Nosy_Default	This axe is fantastic!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_8_Greed_Default	I say we keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_9_Authority_Default	The gem's more important - and to get that, we need to give the axe to Bladefang.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_1_Radulf_NPC	Brok is back with nyarks?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_2_Radulf_NPC	Have the…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_3_WRITTEN_Pragmatic	Here, your axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_4_WRITTEN_Greed	We'll keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_5_Pragmatic_Default	Here it is, your holy axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_6_Radulf_NPC	I knew it was real!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_7_Radulf_NPC	It is magnificent.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_8_Cynical_Default	Nice vocabulary.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_9_Radulf_NPC	You made Bladefang more powerful than ever!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_10_Radulf_NPC	We follow you against Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_11_Greed_Default	It was too hard to get it, it's ours now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC	But axe is orc inheritance.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default	It's Tirmarian, not orc.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC	Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC	Leave Bladefang. Now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default	Look at that! Another library!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default	It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default	But it's makeshift, not Manacalon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC	Home of Sandraven, and Shaman Urka.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN	Why the Manacalon style?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Tell us about the Sandraven tribe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_7_Authority_WRITTEN	Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_8_Nosy_Default	Why is this place made of Manacalon remnants?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_9_Kebra_NPC	Urka very wise shaman.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_10_Kebra_NPC	Reads books.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_11_Nosy_Default	Orcs can read?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_12_Cynical_Default	Amaaazing.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default	What should we know about Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC	Urka loves old elf stuff.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC	Ask you to bring back some, for sure.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_16_Kebra_NPC	But his tribe can fight, useful for facing Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default	Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC	Kebra?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC	I thought you were dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC	Who are your nyark… friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC	They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_22_Urka_NPC	Oh, Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_23_Authority_Default	Urka, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_24_Urka_NPC	Yes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_25_Authority_Default	We need your tribe to support Brok's challenge against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_26_Urka_NPC	Hmmm. First, bring me the key to the sunken city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default	What's that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC	Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC	It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC	But Arrok… he found it first.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_31_Urka_NPC	Found his stone of power there.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC	Now, no one can enter, unless…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC	…unless you go through the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC	Find the Emperor's key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC	Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN	It's a deal!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN	Arrok is already in the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN	The Emperor's key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN	It must be very dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default	If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC	Not more than facing Arrok without help.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default	What is this key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC	It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC	So find his tomb and bring me the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default	Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC	Arrok only found a part of the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC	The key will open many more rooms… to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default	All right, we'll bring you the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default	I think that's the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default	Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default	Let's go find this key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default	That's a change of mood.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default	Fantastic! It's like traveling back in time a thousand years!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default	Well, it still stinks of sulfur.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default	So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default	Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default	It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default	So, they really did rule the world.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default	This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default	Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default	Maybe it's buried, like this city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default	Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default	We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default	Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default	We know…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default	This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default	In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default	It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm and sunk down here. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default	I would have expected something bigger, fancier.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default	Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default	We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default	Prince Kealin, firstborn.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default	His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default	Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default	Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default	Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default	Cute.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default	Show some respect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default	Slavers, the whole lot of them.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC	Who dares disturb the eternal rest of Emperor Laethar?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY	We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY	We got lost.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY	We're clearing your city of orcs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY	We go where we like.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01	This isn't your world anymore - we can go wherever we like!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC	Fool!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC	Your souls will never leave this tomb!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02	Your city is infested with orcs. We're here to clean it up.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC	What are orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default	Smart move!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default	Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03	We just got lost, sorry.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC	Lies of a tomb robber!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04	We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC	Then what do you mean?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC	Monsters, you say? 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC	Clearly, you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang	I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal	Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default	We call them orcs, they're like… dwarves, but worse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC	Really?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC	Then you are on a sacred mission.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC	Monsters must not defile a city of the Emperors.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC	Leave this holy tomb and do what you must.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC	There is Minor Gate by the tapestry of the Aer Elai. Use it to reach the inner city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default	Thank you, your Imperial Majesty.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default	Did you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default	The ghost? Yes, we did.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default	The key! It's in the coffin.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default	Oh, no!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default	So what do we do?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default	Wake him up again and ask nicely?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default	Get ready for a fight.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default	Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default	Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC	You again?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal	Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal	Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang	Time to die for good, dead boy!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC	Liars! Traitors!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default	Urka!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC	I must say, I am impressed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default	You followed us?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC	So you don't have to bring the key back to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default	You really want that key, don't you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC	Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC	Make it easier to take that Crown from you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC	Urka? How? I know him since… child.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default	The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC	But, all these orcs, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default	The Soraks took over a whole world back on Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC	The Crown? It can stop them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default	We think so - hope so.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC	You need Arrok's stone, for real.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC	Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default	Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC	Urka? Big mind like him?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC	I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC	Maybe Arrok is gak, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default	Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC	But Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC	You choose a chief for them, and they follow you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default	Also, Radulf will not come.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default	We couldn't reach an agreement.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC	Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player	What is that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC	Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player	Can't we just kill the guards and go in?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC	Door is magic. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC	But Arrok will open if challenged.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC	We need the tribes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC	Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default	Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC	Look!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default	Is that…?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC	Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default	That did the trick, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default	What are these burned corpses everywhere?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC	Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default	Well, looks like he did half the job for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC	Do we need the tribes, now?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC	I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC	Arrok still very powerful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC	Sure. So we need to take him down fast.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC	We can still backtrack and follow the plan.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default	Uh-huh.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC	Ah, Kebra of Suncloud…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC	…you walk with nyarks? Shame on you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default	You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC	Funny nyark. No, you give me yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default	You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC	Useless worms.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC	Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default	What the…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default	Brok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default	Where are the guards?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC	Surrendered.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default	What?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC	So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default	No big speech, then?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC	No, but door still closed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default	Do you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default	The door?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default	No, there is a… power.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default	I think, though… with the Crown… we might be able to enter.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default	It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default	Do we have a choice?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default	There's always the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default	Is that gem more powerful than the others?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default	Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default	…the gem must have been some sort of catalyst.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default	Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default	That was close!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default	What do you think happened to…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC	…our orc friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default	You mean yours. They're no friends of mine.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default	Burned dead… who cares?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default	They seem more civilized than I expected.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default	Next time we run into some, you can tell them that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default	All right, let's get out of here. It's not safe!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default	This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default	You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default	I've heard that before…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default	…a couple of hundred times since we started…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default	Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default	I so love manual labor! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default	It's Maraike's will!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default	I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang	Chop, don't talk!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Come on, guys! It's just another hedge! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default	Last freakin' hedge I intend to cut through in my lifetime! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default	Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default	Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang	Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default	Hard to believe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Einar strike down me if I lie!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default	Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_3_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	He isn't here, Two-Face - but I am!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	This place will be the death of you, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	This place? How did you get here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	How did you come to this place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	We were sent by our chosen one! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Blessed be his name.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	How did he locate the place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default	Ever heard of the Inquisition? Talk to us now!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC	The chosen one worked some magic. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC	The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	This place is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	What curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Because I know we will all die here! It said so! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Disturbing claims! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default	Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default	…but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default	…and not one single enemy body among them! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default	They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	And what do we do with our friend here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	And yet, we have laws! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	He's too dangerous! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default	Servants of the gods!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default	Protectors of Solasta!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Those statues look weird!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang	Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	But are we entitled to it? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang	What do you mean? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default	And your point being?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	That we would be stealing from the owner!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Naaah - spoils of war!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually.
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Can we just take a peek first? We don't have to take anything. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Just a look, right? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	All right, but don't make me regret it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_13_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Oooops… Sorry? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC	And so the thieves come to meet their doom!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	There are no thieves here! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC	Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default	…by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC	Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC	…if you had just looked! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Had to make sure they weren't fake!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default	We didn't even have a chance to put them back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC	You stole! Otherwise, there would have been no fight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC	And there is only one punishment for theft!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC	Death!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang	This is my kind of fight!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default	Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder… 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default	Wonder about what?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default	Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default	Not to forget the how! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default	This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default	Apparently, the gem was split… to protect it, maybe? 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default	That would explain the traps and monsters.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default	It's one way to make sure this gem is safe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default	But what does it mean?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default	That another Master survived the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default	Someone who doesn't like visitors. 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	What was that? Where are we? 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	You had to step on it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal	Friends, we'll have to think this through! We're a team.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal	And watch where you put your hands in future.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	Don't you loot everything you find?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal	I'm not a Scavenger, mind you.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	Stop it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	…while we wait for you to finish pondering all the…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal	…theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal	Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal	Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_13_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal	By brawn or brains, I don't care which!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	I just felt something!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal	Like what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Like the floor gave a little under my weight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_4_NosyOrElse_Formal	Well, this tile does look a little different! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_5_NosyOrElse_Normal	Spread out! Look for similar tiles!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_6_SelfishnessOrGreed_Normal	What's in it for me? 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_7_NosyOrElse_Normal	A way out! Unless you have a better idea?
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	It worked! The platform shifted!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_2_NosyOrElse_Normal	True - but we're not out of this… labyrinth yet! 
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	True!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_4_NosyOrElse_Formal	We've made progress, though! Let's keep going!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Let's spread out and explore!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_6_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal	Professional trap-finders first!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_7_RogueOrHighestPerception_Normal	Did someone just call for my expertise? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Interesting light, that. Very bright.
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_2_nosyOrElse_Normal	Wonder what it's about?
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Only one way to find out! Come on!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_4_Arcana_DC20_Failure_Normal	Looks like a will-o'-the-wisp to me! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_5_Arcana_DC20_Success_Normal	How fascinating! A new wonder to behold! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_6_RogueOrElse_Normal	Not so fast! There have been enough traps so far to…
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_7_RogueOrElse_Normal	…make me really nervous!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_8_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal	You and me both, my friend! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_9_Crownbearer_Normal	Let's tread carefully, then! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_10_RogueOrAcolyte_Normal	Today is Misaye's birthday! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_11_ClericOrWorshipMaraike_Normal	Maraike's will be done! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_12_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal	Next time, pray harder for a miracle! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_1_HighestPerception_Slang	Einar's sword! What a sight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_2_NosyOrHistoryOrElse_Formal	Unbelievable!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_3_HistoryDC15_Success_Formal	A classical Manacalon manor! What a wonderful sight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_4_HistoryDC15_Failure_Formal	What a weird old building!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_5_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal	Guys, I move two steps back and well… it's gone!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_6_HighestPerception_Normal	What is gone? 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_7_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal	This manor! Something weird is going on!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_8_HighestPerception_Normal	Story of my life!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_9_CynicOrElse_Normal	Weird gets us money and fame! 
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_10_AcolytOrElse_Normal	Do you really have to be so… greedy?
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_11_CynicOrElse_Normal	Not greedy; practical! We do things…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_12_CynicOrElse_Normal	…that no one in their right minds would attempt…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_13_CynicOrElse_Normal	…and we don't do it for nothing!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_14_HelpfulnessOrFriendliness_Normal	Speak for yourself! A good deed is a good deed!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_15_CynicOrElse_Normal	Then let's get in there and see what kind of weirdness we find!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_1_Butler_NPC	Good day to you. My name is Eldorath Smooth-Tongue, the master's housekeeper.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_1_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC	I see you have purloined some of my master's property…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_2_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC	…might I suggest you put those trinkets back where they belong? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_1_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC	Welcome.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_2_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC	Please come with me.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_3_CrownbearerOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Clear skies to you! Where are you taking us?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC	To the master, of course! 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal	And who would that be? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_6_Butler_NPC	That is for not for me to say. All will be made plain in good time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC	I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC	…please don't abuse it.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	We are grateful for your hospitality.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Hospitality? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC	We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC	We have not seen guests of your… quality for some time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Some time? How long, exactly? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC	Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Do you remember any… prominent guests? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15a_Butler_NPC	You were there, Master Kaseinax!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16a_Crownbearer_Normal	Me? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17a_Butler_NPC	I remember it distinctly. Though your form was somewhat different.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	We would never dream of abusing your hospitality!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Someone abused your hospitality in the past?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC	Yes, believe it or not, some… creatures can be…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC	…insufferably rude!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	True nobility is reflected in the character!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC	Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC	…that you would be capable of such discourtesy.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	…might I ask what would be considered rude here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC	Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_18b_Cynic_Slang	So, don't piss in the potted plants, then? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC	Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Really? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC	I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC	But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC	Well met, strangers!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC	Ah, my little thieving visitors.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Clear skies to you, master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC	Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Your plight? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC	That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC	It must have been a thousand years…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC	I am… 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC	How weird, I can't recall my name…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC	Call me master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal	Master of Conjuration!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC	Yes, the Master of Conjuration! Exactly! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal	Greetings, old friend!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal	Why do you call him that?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal	The Crown… told me to.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC	Ah, the Crown…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC	…thank you for coming to my rescue. 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC	My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC	The vanishing of mana left me broken.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Mana was gone? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC	Of course, after the closing of the Rift!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC	That's why my siblings and I were killed or crippled.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC	Kaseinax, and we, the masters, along with these deities…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC	…we poured everything we had into closing and seal that Rift! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	So the Cataclysm is… your fault? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC	It was the price to pay to stop the threat.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC	The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	And so you took a gamble? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC	We were born to rule, not to grovel!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC	And we had sworn to protect our people! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal	You mean your slaves?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC	Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC	But your empire was destroyed.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Who knows how many elves were killed?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC	Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC	Enough about the past! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC	Now I get that you want my gem.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC	But even with his Crown, you're not my Magister!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC	So, if you want it…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC	…you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_07	Kill them!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_08	Intruders!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_09	Don't let them get away!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_10	They're crazy!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_11	They'll kill us if we don't fight back!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_12	I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_13	Found one!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_14	Eh… nothing. Very funny.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_15	Another one, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default	Alright, I'm opening it.
Narration/&Banter_SwitchToCautious	We should be careful.
Narration/&PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC	Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default	Balance and harmony, chaplain!
Narration/&PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC	Fair weather, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC	Good luck and fair weather!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC	Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01	Charming little town…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02	Access to the canyon is blocked!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03	You can't get to the other side - move on!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04	You are not allowed to cross this bridge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01	Careful - I heard something!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02	What were these goblins doing here?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03	There must be some reason.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04	Look - it works!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05	It's something, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06	This is where they're coming from.
Narration/&Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye	Just passing by.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_DalonLark01	Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HalmanSummer01	Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HeddlonSurespell01	Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_JorielFoxeye01	Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_03	Safe travels, adventurers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_03	Watch yourselves outside - the roads are not safe!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives	Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default	Wait… Lisbath stayed back?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default	She was broken.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default	They're gonna kill her!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default	If we go back for her, we die, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default	But… Fine… you're probably right.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01	There's something strange about this place.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02	I feel like someone's watching us.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03	Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04	It's too quiet!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05	This is huge!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06	Did you see that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07	A Defiler. It vanished!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08	We should be careful. We're not alone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01	Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01	I can see something in the water.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02	There's something under the ground.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01	Friends are always welcome at the Shield!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02	Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_03	These walls seem to have been reinforced recently.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_04	Lore text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_05	Lore Text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_06	That elf looks so military in that garb, and those symbols on the tabard! It can only be Empress Cylloriel Wildspirit!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_07	Lore about the hall
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_01	It doesn't do anything. Maybe we're missing something.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_02	We've dealt with this before.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03	We should come back at night.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09	A spectacular place, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10	Are they… ghosts?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11	What other wonders does this place contain?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12	Let's stay on guard.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_02	We're close now, I can feel it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_A	This magic goes far beyond our knowledge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_B	We can't go through here. It's too dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09	Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10	This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn't aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11	Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don't have enough mana to make it work!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07	It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08	This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_09	Maybe this only works at night!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_19_Nope_Formal	We'll see what we can do.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Nope_WRITTEN	We can't promise anything.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Sure_WRITTEN	Sure, we'll do it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13	
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_14	
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_12	Laboratory. ENTRY STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_13	Library
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_14	Salon
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_03	These projections are from the master, not ghosts.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_36_SellswordOrElse_Default	It was too late for him.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_ PuzzleLight_Broken	This symbol is illegible. Perhaps we can find another one elsewhere?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_15	The… projections, they're all gone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_16	This must have something to do with Adrasteia's awakening.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_4_Healer_Any_Normal	She doesn't have any wounds that I can see!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_5_SarcasmOrElse_Normal	Well then, dazzle us and find out what's happening to her!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_15	By all the gods! Manacalon orchids! Clearly, they are correctly named!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_16	"Principles of Architecture", by Karhelas Grayhand! He designed the Teansolais, the imperial palace of Siothyrnas!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_17	This is… Eiradir Fairmind, the justicar, as he presents the first codex of imperial law to the Court!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_01	Wait? Have you ever seen this kind of plant?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_02	The gem must be in this forest. One last effort and it will be ours.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_03	I knew it, we shouldn't have touched that sticky equipment.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_3_Arbal_NPC	Who your nyark friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_4_Arbal_NPC	Eh, nyark speaks! Kebra teach them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_10_Arbal_NPC	Before Arrok, Arbal would kill nyarks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_13_Arbal_NPC	Not nice, no.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_15_Orcishspeaker_Default	Ah! Thank you, nyark - that make my day.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_04	It's too thick, we won't make it like this!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_01	What was that? Where are we?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_00	Go back to where you came from, you insignificant beings. You are not worthy to enter.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_01	I laugh at the emptiness of your actions.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_02	Play the wise, you fools. Go ahead.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_1	Let's stay together. These caves are dark and full of terrors.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_2	Do you remember where we come from?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Greed_1	It's too easy… 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01	The gem, we found it!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02	Where are the Soraks?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1	The gold just disappears in my hands!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01	Edrof says gate closed for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_02	Bloodspear tribe is strong!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_03	Nyark go talk to Edrof. Only he give order to open passage.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_04	Brok strong chief! He defeated Edrof.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_01	Kebra survived! Kebra strong.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_02	Nyark want to trade?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_03	Bloodspear strong tribe! Bloodspear plenty.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_04	Nyarks friend with Brok. Brok strong chief!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_01	Nyarks go see Radulf!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_02	Radulf great Shaman.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_03	Nyark got mighty axe?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_04	Nyarks have spider webs in hair.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_01	Brok new chief? Brok not dead?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_02	Nyarks need food?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_03	Bladefang best tribe. Bladefang got big shaman!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04	Kebra friend with nyarks?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01	Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02	This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03	No greataxe means we are not joining you.
Narration/&Tavern_02_41_Player_Default	Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_02_42_Player_Default	Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…
Narration/&Tavern_02_43_Merton	You think I don't know the difference?
Narration/&Tavern_02_44_Merton	All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!
Narration/&Tavern_02_45_Merton	Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!
Narration/&Tavern_02_46_Player_Default	No one believes in Soraks anymore.
Narration/&Tavern_02_47_Player_Default	Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them.
Narration/&Tavern_02_48_Player_Default	Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith.
Narration/&Tavern_02_49_Merton	Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…
Narration/&Tavern_02_50_Merton	…anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know.
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Player_Default	Oh, come on!
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Merton	You'll see.
Narration/&Tavern_02_52_Player_Default	Anyway…
Narration/&Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default	Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb	The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b	Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b	Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b	No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b	It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b	Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings.
Narration/&Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…
Narration/&Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	…in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!
Narration/&Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC	Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them.
Narration/&Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC	We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed.
Narration/&Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction.
Narration/&Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC	Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01	Yes… I understand.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02	Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03	Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04	We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05	What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06	We're supposed to share the loot, by the way.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08	Forget it, let's get out of here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default	Are they all undead in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Default	Undead? What other abominations are in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Default	Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Default	Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Default	Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default	There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player	A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player	Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Player	Stay in the light! It is our only protection.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Player	Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default	Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default	Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default	Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default	And certainly not lizardfolk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21b_Player	So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21c_Player	Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21d_Player	Was he one of them all along, do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default	Doesn't have the big spines…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default	It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default	Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default	Stop losing time, it's just a statue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01	Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02	It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03	Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04	I see the point of the Scavengers now…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05	Why not keep this to ourselves?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01	Crap! The book just turned into dust!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02	Damn! This book is… not really here!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03	Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04	The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05	I should have known… it was too good to be true.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default	That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default	He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default	I can't remember much more.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default	"A" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default	The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. "Sorr-Akkath" means "beloved of Sorr-Tarr" in their tongue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default	I've heard whispers of cultists with an "A" tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default	There's a name, too: "Arivad."
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default	These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default	We better be careful.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default	And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak.
Narration/&InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default	Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality.
Narration/&InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC	It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC	You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance.
Narration/&InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC	Did you find anything else that could help us track them?
Narration/&InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC	There was a parchment. 
Narration/&InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC	If you find it, send for the Tshar.
Narration/&InTemple_7_Curious_NPC	You can read that?
Narration/&InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC	That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue.
Narration/&InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC	I knew it!
Narration/&InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC	It means "general."
Narration/&InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC	You were wise to run.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default	Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default	…they all had this tattoo on their arm.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default	And we found this letter.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default	It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	It is indeed one of their ways. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Now this, is the A of Arivad.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default	Can you enlighten us?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default	Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Of course.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	We paladins and clerics of Einar are the guardians of these memories.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	At the site of the rift, thousands of Soraks tried to cross.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Sorr-Tarr himself tried.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	I supposed that's another one of their tricks.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	…it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	So that, if one day, they were to return.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	We'd be ready.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	I'm sorry to say, after a thousand years, only few of us remain.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	But you brought us proof.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The Soraks are not extinct.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO	Are there different Soraks?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default	We fought different ones, do you know more?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Some of them are deadly assassins - invisible, venomous.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Others are giant brutes.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	The Shikkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO	Can they mimic people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default	Can they really impersonate people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	It's been proven, though it's a long process.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Upon death, they would return to their original form.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO	Why do people follow them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default	How do they get people to worship them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	They get into people's minds…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	…learn their darkest secrets, their fears, their shameful desires.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default	Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC	If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple.
Narration/&InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC	Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded.
Narration/&InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC	Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again.
Narration/&Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC	Deputies!
Narration/&Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC	Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?
Narration/&Council02_Final3_Any_Default	Yes, madam.
Narration/&Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC	That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?
Narration/&Council02_Final5_Any_Default	Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch.
Narration/&Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC	What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?
Narration/&Council02_Final7_Any_Default	It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely.
Narration/&Council02_Final8_Any_Default	And it may not be totally safe.
Narration/&Council02_Final9_Any_Default	Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose.
Narration/&Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC	This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service.
Narration/&Council02_Final11_Any_Default	You're welcome.
Narration/&Council02_Final12_Any_Formal	Chancellor.
Narration/&Exposition1_Beric_NPC	Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens.
Narration/&Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC	We should deputize them right away.
Narration/&Exposition3_Beric_NPC	They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return.
Narration/&Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC	We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?
Narration/&Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC	Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already.
Narration/&Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC	Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter.
Narration/&Exposition7_Beric_NPC	Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war.
Narration/&Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC	That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!
Narration/&Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC	Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!
Narration/&Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC	Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!
Narration/&Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC	Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!
Narration/&Exposition12_Beric_NPC	I know. The Council must hold.
Narration/&Exposition13_Beric_NPC	Let's get our new deputies to work.
Narration/&CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC	Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_2_Player_Default	Again?
Narration/&CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC	Well, I'm here at your service, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A	Ask for details about the geography.
Narration/&CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1	Ask for details about the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2	Ask for details about the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3	Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B	Ask for details about the politics.
Narration/&CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1	Ask for details about the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2	Ask for details about the factions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3	Ask for details about the Scavengers.
Narration/&CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics	Change the general topic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_13_Player_Default	Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?
Narration/&CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC	Really? Right.
Narration/&CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC	The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…
Narration/&CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC	…to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC	The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade.
Narration/&CarranTalk_19_Player_Default	Why are you recruiting adventurers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC	To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…
Narration/&CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC	…and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything.
Narration/&CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC	Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it.
Narration/&CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC	We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation.
Narration/&CarranTalk_23_Carran_NPC	It's a… fresh idea. I'm afraid it hasn't had much success so far.
Narration/&CarranTalk_24_Carran_NPC	Captain Merran is a great example for beginners.
Narration/&CarranTalk_25_Carran_NPC	But the events in Caer Lem… well, we lost almost all of our people there.
Narration/&CarranTalk_27_Carran_NPC	Captain Henrik's demise sends the wrong message.
Narration/&CarranTalk_28_Carran_NPC	Lord Stonebeard, an influential member of the Snow Alliance is also very…
Narration/&CarranTalk_29_Carran_NPC	…doubtful about the whole concept.
Narration/&CarranTalk_30_Carran_NPC	I thought you knew, since you're in it…
Narration/&CarranTalk_31_Player_Default	What can you tell us about the Scavengers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_32_Carran_NPC	I would say: don't be fooled by the name.
Narration/&CarranTalk_33_Carran_NPC	Some of them were already exploring the Old Empire before the Copperhead Road…
Narration/&CarranTalk_34_Carran_NPC	…when it was near impossible to get through the mountains and into the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_35_Carran_NPC	Most of them are now providing services to adventurers, and the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_36_Carran_NPC	I supposed you've already met Annie Bagmordah, her leader.
Narration/&CarranTalk_37_Carran_NPC	What factions are in play here?
Narration/&CarranTalk_38_Carran_NPC	The Circle of Danantar is based here in the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_39_Carran_NPC	His leader, Lord Edvan Danantar, is a renowned Spellblade master.
Narration/&CarranTalk_40_Carran_NPC	The Guild of Antiquarians is from the Snow Alliance, to the north.
Narration/&CarranTalk_41_Carran_NPC	They crave anything of historical value, even mundane items…
Narration/&CarranTalk_42_Carran_NPC	…as long as they're old enough.
Narration/&CarranTalk_43_Carran_NPC	The Tower of Knowledge is from the Kingdom of Gallivan…
Narration/&CarranTalk_44_Carran_NPC	…they are academics, interested in all kinds of… well, knowledge.
Narration/&CarranTalk_45_Carran_NPC	The Arcaneum is from the New Empire…
Narration/&CarranTalk_46_Carran_NPC	…magic is their passion, especially ancient, Manacalon magic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_47_Carran_NPC	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_48_Carran_NPC	And… stay in the light.
Narration/&CarranTalk_49_Carran_NPC	I'll be here to answer your questions…
Narration/&CarranTalk_50_Carran_NPC	…unless I'm busy with Council affairs.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_01	Where are we landing this time? 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_02	The lake shouldn't be dried up with such a flow coming from the river.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_02	What do you think? Fight or leave?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	You had to touch it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	…magic came out of nowhere! Targeting us! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	And how is that a curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	After each death, it… it said it again!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Freeze, Soraks! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_2_Sellsword_Slang	Time to show them who we are! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	They haven't seen us yet! No need to rush!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_4_Sellsword_Slang	It comes down to the same thing in the end!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Look - they've gone into that shed! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_6_SpyOrHighestperception_Default	It's pretty small for so many Soraks. Tunnel entrance?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_NotHighestInt_Default	No reason to wait, they're gone.
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_9_HighestWisorElse_Default	What if they come out?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	We'll kill them.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight1_Starter_Default	What just happened?!
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight2_Cynical_Default	A gem… right?
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight3_Cynical_Default	Just like that.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight4_Selfpres_Default	Did you hear that? 
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight5_Sellsword_Default	The sound of killing.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight6_Starter_Default	The Soraks.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight7_Selfpres_Default	That was fast.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight8_Sellsword_Default	You afraid?
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight9_Selfpres_Default	Of course not.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_TheBeast_02	A comfortable golden mattress.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_TheSuperEgo_03	Another one of these platforms!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_01	All this movement is making me dizzy.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_02	Be careful, it could be dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_03	What kind of tormented mind built this place?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_04	Have we been killed and sent to the afterlife? I don't know what to make of it.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheEgo_05	Rotate, again and again.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_A_1	Just open the door!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_A_2	I promise I'll be good! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_B_1	You can't leave! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Slave_Escape_B_2	None of us can leave!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_1	The Master sees all!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_2	Don't do it! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_if_Stolen_1	Fools! The Redeemers won't stay hungry long!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Treasure_Room_if_Stolen_2	Pray for mercy! But don't expect it! 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Help_1	So tired, so hungry, and the day is still young!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_Servant_Help_2	Thank you, kind stranger!

Narration/&EndingCinematic_02	Never again would so many gods unite their forces to create a passage through the worlds.
Narration/&EndingCinematic_03	Sorr-Tarr would remain on Tirmar until the end of time.
Narration/&EndingCinematic_04	But his children of darkness had set foot on Solasta.
Narration/&EndingCinematic_05	And planted the seeds of evil.
Narration/&EndingCinematic_06	Deeper than anyone could have imagined.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_Bone_Yard_01	Nothing here.
